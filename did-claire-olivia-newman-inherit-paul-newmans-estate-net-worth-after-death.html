His estate is worth even more, approximately $600 million.</p><p>Let’s do some math. 50% of $600 million is $300 million, and if divided by six children, that would be a whopping $50 million for Claire Newman and her siblings. However, this is the full estimate of his estate, so the residual amount would entail a different number. But does it matter?

Before Claire and her siblings filed the will for probate, they contemplated asking for a 10-day postponement.</p><p>They consulted with several attorneys about the petition and concluded that asking for clarification on the alterations was not inappropriate.
