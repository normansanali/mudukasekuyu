Much of her career is owed to inspiring collaborations with numerous <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> talents. This includes the one she shares with her <a href=#>faithful producer and <strong>close friend, Jack Antonoff</strong></a>. Together, the pair have worked on every one of her albums since<strong> 2014's "1989"</strong>. While Antonoff's musical contributions aren't exclusive to Swift's discography, their partnership has been nothing short of legendary. On top of this, Antonoff is credited as a producer on most of <a href=#>Swift's best and most popular songs</a>.</p><p>During an interview with Vulture, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Antonoff revealed the hardest parts of his music career</a>, including <strong>producing Taylor Swift's music</strong>. Given their lengthy and close relationship, Antonoff is uniquely qualified to comment on what Swift is really like to work with. And during his interview, he did just that. Beyond her sweet smile, accessibility, and celebrity status, here's what Taylor Swift is really like when making her albums...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-taylor-swift-is-like-in-the-recording-studio-according-to-producer-jack-antonoff>What Taylor Swift Is Like In The Recording Studio, According To Producer Jack Antonoff</h2><p>During music producer Jack Antonoff's 2024 interview with Vulture, the <strong>frequent Taylor Swift collaborator </strong>explained that he <strong>recorded most of "Midnights" in his apartment</strong>. His New York apartment has a studio space that he and Swift have called 'home' throughout their lengthy collaboration. This space has also been useful for Antonoff's own recordings with <strong>his band Bleachers </strong>and with other close collaborators such as Lana Del Rey. But given that Taylor Swift is arguably the biggest music superstar in the world, it's remarkable that she loves recording in a studio in an apartment as opposed to one in a fancy or iconic facility.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-shocked-fans-after-revealing-intense-anxiety-around-her-new-music-leaking-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Antonoff, who <strong>won a 2024 Grammy for Producer of the Year</strong>, Non-Classical, and one for producing <strong>Swift's Album of the Year ("Midnights")</strong>, claimed that he'd gladly work with Swift for decades to come. Much of this comes down to the fact that he and Swift are always willing to try some "weird s***" in the recording studio. This includes basing part of their song "Mastermind" on the ending of Daniel Day Lewis' movie, Phantom Thread.</p><p>"Every once in a while, when you really throw yourself out there, you actually get the stuff that’s the most brilliant," Jack Antonoff told Vulture of his experimentations with Swift.</p><p>"I’ve never been in a room with her and felt like we were doing anything but treading new ground that we’ve let last for even ten seconds.

I mean, we started working together on '’89', we did a ton of work on 'Reputation', which was so wonderful and intense, and then 'Lover', we started to do some more strange things," Antonoff explained.</p><p>"When we did 'Folklore', that was obviously a really different angle, and some of the earlier songs, like “August” and “Mirrorball,” are some of my favorite things we’ve ever done. You know, writing a song and collaborating with somebody, once you do it, you’re like, Well, who knows if that’ll ever happen again, ’cause it’s just magic. With her, I’m constantly taken aback."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Antonoff went on to say, "I’ll joke with her sometimes when we get something crazy, like, 'Okay, I guess we still f***ing got it!' There’s really nothing for her and I left to do if we’re not completely stretching ourselves out there into the darkness. And that was the whole story with 'Midnights' — we did so many things that we had never done before."</p><ul><li><strong>Taylor Swift's "Midnights" was released in October 2022</strong></li><li><strong>Jack Antonoff served as producer on "Midnights" alongside Swift, Sounwave, Jahaan Sweet, and Keanu Beats</strong></li></ul><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_fans-are-worried-about-taylor-swift-s-relationship-with-travis-kelce-after-his-super-bowl-win_bk_a1__v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Are Worried For Taylor Swift's Relationship With Travis Kelce After His Super Bowl Win">Fans Are Worried For Taylor Swift's Relationship With Travis Kelce After His Super Bowl Win</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>While Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce celebrated the Kansas City Chiefs' 2024 Super Bowl victory, the singer's fans were upset with his behavior.</p><p>On top of Taylor Swift's deep desire to push herself and do something different, producer Jack Antonoff claimed that she is always exceedingly vulnerable.

I remember she wrote that right in front of me and then we put it down, and I was completely punched in the gut. Beautiful."</p><p>In the 2022 song, "You're On Your Own Kid", Taylor Swift reflected on her music career and her ascension from the country music scene to becoming a pop megastar. In the song, she wrote a particular lyric that Jakc Antonoff was impressed by. This was in the song's bridge when she includes, “‘Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned / Everything you lose is a step you take.”</p><h2 id=this-is-the-hardest-part-about-working-with-taylor-swift-according-to-friend-jack-antonoff>This Is The Hardest Part About Working With Taylor Swift, According To Friend Jack Antonoff</h2><p>Unfortunately for readers eager for revelations about <strong>a possible dark side to Taylor Swift</strong>, it appears that she is nothing but a gem in the recording studio. At least, this is Jack Antonoff's experience. The two are exceptionally close friends with <a href=#>Swift even asked to speak at his wedding to Margaret Qualley</a>. But there is one or two <strong>difficult things about working with Swift</strong>, according to Antonoff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_scarlett-johansson-went-to-prom-with-taylor-swift-s-frequent-collaborator_bk_a1.jpg><p>In his 2024 interview with Vulture, Antonoff revealed that Swift has some tastes that are different than what he's become accustomed to as both a producer and a musician. In the case of recording<strong> "1989"(Aka "Taylor's Version")</strong>, Antonoff found it difficult to work with the soft synth sounds required for "Out Of The Woods", "I Wish You Would", and "You Are In Love".</p><p>Because of this, he chose to use only sounds that were made in the recording studio and enlisted his colleagues from his band Bleachers to help him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The internet was really interested in what sounded like a seagull sound in “Is It Over Now?” It was really fun because it was all these analog instruments that we know and love: Moog model Ds, Juno-6s," Antonoff revealed to Vulture.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:03</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-s-parents-may-live-a-life-of-luxury-despite-false-claims-about-their-abandoned-tiktok-mansion-front-deposit-back-instar.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Parents May Live A Life Of Luxury Despite False Claims About Their Abandoned TikTok Mansion">Taylor Swift's Parents May Live A Life Of Luxury Despite False Claims About Their Abandoned TikTok Mansion</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>What is the truth about how Taylor Swift's parents live following rumors about their mansion?</p><p>One of Antonoff's hardest moments with Swift was on the song, "August".</p><p>"The end of “August,” the strings and twangy guitar — that was one where it was really in my head, production-wise, for a long time.
