And even if I did get up and move, it wasn't like that made it better, I just couldn't stop … it was horrible, it's like being whipped.</p><p>"It sounds melodramatic, but I think if I had to pick whipping or akathisia … a cat-o'-nine-tails, that might be worse, but it was plenty bad. And things just fell apart more and more."</p><p>In November 2019, Peterson entered a rehab centre in New York but after that failed, he flew to Russia for emergency treatment, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and spent eight days in a medically-induced coma.</p><p>The process was brutal, but Peterson began to recover, moving to a clinic in Florida and then Belgrade – before being struck down by coronavirus.</p><p>In short, it has been an almost unbelievable series of horrendous circumstances that totally derailed the Peterson family's lives – and from which they are still recovering.</p><h2 class=article__heading>So what next?</h2><p>Peterson's recovery is still very much a work in progress, and whether or not he'll return to public life to the same extent as before is still up in the air.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>And apart from the physical and emotional trauma, there's also the question of how Peterson's image will recover. He freely acknowledges his drug dependence as "ethically questionable".</p><p>"Because you think, well, the person obviously made some errors in choice that contributed to this," he said.</p><p>"Like, why would anyone take anything I say seriously?"</p><p>But Peterson has also been inundated with support from loyal followers after the frank admission.</p><p>And he is unlikely to sit on the sidelines for long, provided his health continues to improve.</p><p>In his own words: "I guess what I would say is if you're going to wait to learn from people who don't make mistakes, or don't have tragedy in their life …"</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZqKmo56xpnnToZxmqKKew6LAxGaqraqlnLStsdJmpp9lk6S7tb7Or5yrq5mWuW6t1K2fqKpdn7yzsMCnZKmdpJq%2FtLvNaIGDgXSHnHijt4KRcI58a5x1nal8jIuRf2qmcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-the-private-struggles-of-controversial-author-jordan-peterson.html&text=Inside%20the%20private%20struggles%20of%20controversial%20author%20Jordan%20Peterson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-the-private-struggles-of-controversial-author-jordan-peterson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-private-struggles-of-controversial-author-jordan-peterson.html&title=Inside%20the%20private%20struggles%20of%20controversial%20author%20Jordan%20Peterson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-the-private-struggles-of-controversial-author-jordan-peterson.html&title=Inside%20the%20private%20struggles%20of%20controversial%20author%20Jordan%20Peterson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-the-private-struggles-of-controversial-author-jordan-peterson.html&title=Inside%20the%20private%20struggles%20of%20controversial%20author%20Jordan%20Peterson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-the-private-struggles-of-controversial-author-jordan-peterson.html&description=Inside%20the%20private%20struggles%20of%20controversial%20author%20Jordan%20Peterson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jaylon-mcdaniel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jaylon Mcdaniel | Fan Arch">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-tall-is-mikey-williams.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How tall is Mikey Williams?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
