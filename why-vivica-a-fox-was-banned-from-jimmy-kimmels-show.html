For many years, nobody knew the reason. Then, Kimmel revealed the reason years later, accusing Fox of doing something that went against her character.</p><h2 id=vivica-a-fox-started-wild-rumors-in-the-past>Vivica A. Fox Started Wild Rumors In The Past</h2><p>During a chat on Out Loud with Claudia Jordan, Fox spoke about The Real Housewives of Atlanta star Nene Leakes.</p><p>During Leakes' Instagram Live talk show Cocktails & Conversation in 2020, she spoke with Basketball Wives star Jennifer Williams about a Real Housewives reunion episode. <a href=#>Leakes said that she felt traumatized by what transpired in the reunion</a> and that she was seeing a therapist.</p><p>Fox later implied that the reason Leakes was seeing a therapist was due to a problem with substance abuse. Fox said that she saw something underneath Leakes' nose during the reunion. This implied that Leakes was struggling with an addiction to cocaine. Jordan said that Fox seemed to be sweating, but Fox wasn't sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar46095643.jpg><p>Leakes later appeared on The Breakfast Club and responded to Fox's claim.</p><p>"That was really f***ed up, okay," Leakes said. "Let me tell you how f***** up that is. I have never done any drugs. I’ve never even smoked a cigarette in my life, okay. So I’ve had family members —I speak about this on the show — that’s been on drugs before. I’ve never been on drugs. Now, I’ve been on plenty of vodka, but I ain’t never been on no drugs before. I will never do drugs, okay."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>NeNe Leakes’ Greatest One-Liners From Real Housewives</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leakes added, "That’s nothing that I’ve ever done. I don’t smoke cigarettes, cigars, weed, do coke..I’ve never even tried it. So for somebody to go so low and insinuate something like that to defame your character is really effed up. And I thought me and Vivica was cool. I … is she on drugs? Don’t ever put me in that category, okay. You can put me in a lot of categories. But the drug category.. you will never be able to put me there. That’s a whole disrespectful.. it’s defaming your character, and it’s f***** up."</p><h2 id=farrah-abraham-criticizes-vivica-following-her-drug-test-results>Farrah Abraham Criticizes Vivica Following Her Drug Test Results</h2><p>Farrah Abraham is best known for her time on the MTV show Teen Mom. In 2018, Abraham returned to television on the daytime talk show Face the Truth, hosted by Fox. During the show, Abraham agreed to take a drug test in order to show her estranged mother Debra Danielsen that she wasn't on drugs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Farrah Abraham's Latest Parenting Decision Is Earning Her Backlash (And Money)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The results came back positive for Barbiturates and Abraham started to say they weren't real. Abraham did an interview with Radar Online, <a href=#>where she dragged Fox and the show</a>, calling it "fake."</p><p>"I was just actually more disappointed in the press that Vivica had to do in order to get press for her show," Abraham said.</p><p>"She’s like, ‘Oh, people are sending in letters,’ No. You have a fake audience, you attack women, your advice isn’t even credible that you’re giving someone as I do go to therapy, I do have family therapy ongoing with my mom. I take it upon myself to have the best health to not have anything in — anything my doctors give me. Their drug test was false. My doctors all looked at everything they gave me, there’s no Barbiturates in there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel-banned-vivica-a-fox-after-she-walked-off-the-show>Jimmy Kimmel Banned Vivica A. Fox After She Walked Off The Show</h2><p>When Fox was a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2005, her appearance didn't exactly rub the late night host the right way.</p><p>It started off on the wrong foot when Kimmel introduced Fox by stating her many accomplishments and ending with, "...and most harrowing of all, Star Jones' bridesmaid."</p><p>It was clear the Fox didn't appreciate this very much and <a href=#>made it very clear that she didn't appreciate Kimmel's jokes</a> about her friend.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Vivica A.

The four of us should get together — me, you, Star and [Star’s then-husband] Al [Reynolds]."</p><p>Fox responded, "You would get your a** kicked."</p><p>At that moment, Fox stood up and walked off the set and Kimmel spent the remainder of the segment focusing on her empty chair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar50184222.jpg><p>In 2014, Kimmel recalled the incident when speaking to Andy Cohen. Kimmel said that he believed Fox was on drugs. He also pointed out how that would go against Fox's anti-drug message.</p><p><a href=#>Cohen later spoke to Fox herself</a> during an episode of Watch What Happens Live and asked her side of the story.</p><p>"I was really surprised, because I used to go on his show all the time. And there was just one time that I went on the show and he dissed my good friend Star Jones," she said.</p><p>Fox then said that she was surprised to hear she was banned, because Kimmel apologized to her privately.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdq7a3tcKaZJpllqTFbsPArGSbmZ6jsqV5xaumpmWanrquxYykoKallaHAbr%2FHqK5o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-vivica-a-fox-was-banned-from-jimmy-kimmels-show.html&text=The%20Real%20Reason%20Vivica%20A.%20Fox%20Won%27t%20Be%20Returning%20To%20This%20Late%20Night%20Talk%20Show&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-vivica-a-fox-was-banned-from-jimmy-kimmels-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-vivica-a-fox-was-banned-from-jimmy-kimmels-show.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Vivica%20A.%20Fox%20Won%27t%20Be%20Returning%20To%20This%20Late%20Night%20Talk%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-vivica-a-fox-was-banned-from-jimmy-kimmels-show.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Vivica%20A.%20Fox%20Won%27t%20Be%20Returning%20To%20This%20Late%20Night%20Talk%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-vivica-a-fox-was-banned-from-jimmy-kimmels-show.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Vivica%20A.%20Fox%20Won%27t%20Be%20Returning%20To%20This%20Late%20Night%20Talk%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-vivica-a-fox-was-banned-from-jimmy-kimmels-show.html&description=The%20Real%20Reason%20Vivica%20A.%20Fox%20Won%27t%20Be%20Returning%20To%20This%20Late%20Night%20Talk%20Show" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./desiigner-fame.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Things You Don't Know About Desiigner">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./suspect-arrested-in-shocking-attempted-abduction-in-nyc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suspect arrested in shocking attempted abduction in NYC">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
