Despite leading the team to the World Series, he did not have a contract in place for the following season, making him a rare case among coaches. However, if Dusty signs a new deal with the Astros, it could prove to be quite lucrative for him.</p><h2><span id=Dusty_Bakers_Early_Life>Dusty Baker’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Dusty Baker was born in Riverside, California in 1949 and moved to the Sacramento area with his family at the age of 14. He attended Del Campo High School where he excelled in multiple sports including baseball, football, basketball, and track.

Despite this, Baker signed with the Braves, resulting in a seven-year estrangement from his dad.</p><h2><span id=Bakers_MLB_Career_and_Military_Service>Baker’s MLB Career and Military Service</span></h2><p>Dusty Baker made his MLB debut as an outfielder for the Atlanta Braves in 1968.

He replaced Roger Craig as manager in 1993, leading the Giants to a 103-59 record in his first year. This success earned him the NL Manager of the Year Award.</p><p>During Baker’s leadership, the Giants won division titles in 1997 and 2000, and even advanced to the World Series in 2002. His regular-season record as Giants manager was 840 wins and 715 losses.</p><h2><span id=Bakers_Time_as_Cubs_Manager>Baker’s Time as Cubs Manager</span></h2><p>In 2002, Dusty Baker became the manager of the Chicago Cubs, replacing Don Baylor. He led the team to their first division title in 14 years and their first postseason series victory since 1908.

He experienced his peak with the team in 2010, winning the Central Division title and making the team’s first playoff appearance in 15 years. The Reds claimed the Central title again in 2012, even though Baker was in the hospital at the time. However, after the team’s sixth consecutive loss in the next season, Baker was fired. His record with the team was 509 wins and 463 losses in the regular season.</p><h2><span id=Dusty_Bakers_Managerial_Career_with_the_Nationals>Dusty Baker’s Managerial Career with the Nationals</span></h2><p>In 2016, Dusty Baker became the manager of the Washington Nationals, leading them to win the NL East.

Baker has contributed to the organization by appearing in several educational videos and other content.</p><h2><span id=Dusty_Bakers_Battle_with_the_IRS>Dusty Baker’s Battle with the IRS</span></h2><p>In the late 1980s, Dusty Baker invested in various tax shelters based on his brother’s advice. This decision led to trouble with the IRS, and Dusty’s debt reached several million dollars. By the late 1990s, despite earning $900,000 annually as the manager of the San Francisco Giants, his wages were being garnished by the IRS to the point that he was only allotted 1% of his salary to live off of, or about $90,000 per year.</p><p>To help him through this period, Giants owner Peter Magowan loaned Baker $1 million as part of a contract negotiation in 2000. The IRS issues were resolved soon after, and when Baker was hired by the Chicago Cubs in 2003, he repaid the loan in full.</p><h2><span id=Dusty_Bakers_Granite_Bay_Estate>Dusty Baker’s Granite Bay Estate</span></h2><p>In 2003, Dusty Baker purchased a 5-acre plot of land in Granite Bay, California for $589,000.

Today, this estate is estimated to be worth $5-6 million.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCw1KyrsmWSlrimvoynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdusty-baker-net-worth.html&text=Dusty%20Baker%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdusty-baker-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdusty-baker-net-worth.html&title=Dusty%20Baker%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdusty-baker-net-worth.html&title=Dusty%20Baker%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdusty-baker-net-worth.html&title=Dusty%20Baker%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdusty-baker-net-worth.html&description=Dusty%20Baker%20Net%20Worth%20-%20Pulptastic" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./erik-cole-net-worth-198837.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erik Cole Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ashley-ortega.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashley Ortega- Bio, Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating, Height">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
