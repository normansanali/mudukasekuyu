Here's a detailed exploration of who Jackson Mahomes is, his <a href=#>relationship</a> with Patrick Mahomes, and some of the notable incidents associated with him.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jackson Mahomes: An Overview</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jackson Mahomes, born on May 15, 2000, is 23 years old and is primarily known as the brother of NFL star quarterback Patrick Mahomes II. He has gained a substantial following on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, where he shares insights into his lifestyle. Jackson has managed to amass over 240,000 followers on Instagram and an impressive 1.1 million fans on his verified TikTok channel.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Relationship with Patrick Mahomes</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jackson Mahomes shares a strong bond with his older brother, Patrick. Despite Patrick's fame and professional <a href=#>success</a>, Jackson has emphasized that their relationship is like that of any other siblings. He has described their bond as "super close" and highlighted their great relationship. Jackson is not only close to Patrick but also shares a loving relationship with Patrick's wife, Brittany Mahomes, and is the adoring uncle of Patrick's two children, Sterling Mahomes and Patrick "Bronze" Lavon Mahomes III.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Notable Incidents and Controversies</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Jackson Mahomes has garnered attention for his close relationship with his brother, he has also been the subject of various controversies. In 2021, he recorded a TikTok dance on the field at the Washington Commanders’ stadium, which involved standing on the uniform number of Sean Taylor, an NFL star who was being honored with a jersey retirement ceremony that day. This incident sparked <a href=#>controversy</a>, and Jackson eventually apologized, stating that he meant no disrespect.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another incident involved Jackson pouring water on fans in Baltimore after a Chiefs loss, which he later justified by stating that the fans were "thirsty". However, the most significant controversy surrounding Jackson Mahomes is the accusation of aggravated sexual battery. In May 2023, he was arrested and charged with three counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of battery after allegedly assaulting a restaurant owner. Despite this, three of the four charges against him were dropped in January 2024.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Social Media Influence</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jackson Mahomes has established himself as a social media influencer, leveraging his connection to his famous brother and his friendship with Brittany Mahomes to become a regular presence at NFL games and other events. His social media following, especially on TikTok, has contributed to his growing popularity and influence.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to his social media presence, Jackson has also ventured into merchandise, announcing his "Unathletic" and "Jackson From TikTok" merch in September 2020. Through this endeavor, he aimed to establish his own identity and overcome the shadow of being primarily known as "Patrick Mahomes' brother".</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jackson Mahomes, as the younger brother of the accomplished NFL <a href=#>quarterback</a> Patrick <a href=#>Mahomes</a>, has carved out a significant presence for himself through social media and his close relationship with his brother and his family. While he has faced controversies and negative attention, he continues to be a prominent figure in the public eye. His experiences serve as a testament to the complexities of being related to a famous figure and the challenges of establishing one's own identity in the shadow of a celebrated sibling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlmah6sa3Tq6Cco12irqm7zJ6qZpqipMGpsdE%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-patrick-mahomes-brother.html&text=Who%20Is%20Patrick%20Mahomes%27%20Brother%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-patrick-mahomes-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-patrick-mahomes-brother.html&title=Who%20Is%20Patrick%20Mahomes%27%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-patrick-mahomes-brother.html&title=Who%20Is%20Patrick%20Mahomes%27%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-patrick-mahomes-brother.html&title=Who%20Is%20Patrick%20Mahomes%27%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-patrick-mahomes-brother.html&description=Who%20Is%20Patrick%20Mahomes%27%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./171792-apple-scraps-jon-stewart-show-china-ai-clashes-report.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Apple scraps Jon Stewart show over China, AI clashes: report">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-cross-patton-meet-the-big-bois-son-on-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Cross Patton?
