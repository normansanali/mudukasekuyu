However, she attained superstar status when she began appearing in the Baywatch series in 1992, which would last for five seasons until 1997. She was paid a salary of $1,500 per episode for her first season, but thereafter, she was one of the highest-paid TV actresses of her time by earning $300,000 per episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:</span></p><p>Besides doing cover photos for Playboy and reprising her role in Baywatch, Pamela Anderson also tried her luck in the entertainment film industry. Her debut film, called Barb Wire, was released in 1996, but bombed terribly at the box office, grossing only $3.8 million against a $9 million budget. She also starred in the 1994 action thriller, Raw Justice, which grossed over $35 million worldwide. By the time she met Tommy Lee in 1995, she was worth $30 million and, over the years, her other film and television appearances have helped her maintain most of her fortune.

She moved into his home in Malibu, California shortly after. Reports suggest that the couple filed a $10 million lawsuit against one of Lee's employees for stealing Tommy Lee's safe. The stolen safe, which contained <a href=#>Lee and Anderson's infamous sex tape</a>, in revenge for firing him. It's not clear how much Anderson contributed to the lawsuit, but it could be anywhere north of $5 million.</p><p>What's for certain is that Pamela Anderson lost millions because of the lawsuit. It was also reported that <a href=#>Lee once spent $400 on sex toys for Anderson.</a> But their marriage came to an end in 1998 following a domestic dispute that landed Lee in jail for six months on charges of spousal abuse.

By April 2002, the couple announced that they were engaged after Rock proposed to her in Las Vegas. However, things appeared to have fallen through the cracks when Anderson began hinting at their separation the following summer.

She agreed to his proposal, and the rest was history. They tied the knot at The Mirage in Las Vegas, only to separate and have the marriage annulled two months later.

But, ironically, the Scary Movie actress could stand to gain the most out of this relationship than the rest.

The two struck up a romance and got married on Christmas Eve 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>However, being quarantined together for extensive periods took its toll on the newly-weds, and Pamela Anderson's romantic fire eventually fizzled out.
