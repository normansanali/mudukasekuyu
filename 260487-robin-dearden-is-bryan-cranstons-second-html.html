Today, the couple remains as happy as ever, but very little is known about the actor's wife. Here are some facts to note about her.</p><p class=dh>Bryan Cranston is best known as the star of the popular series "Breaking Bad," where he played the lead character, Walter White, a character much loved by fans of the show.</p><p class=dh>But off the screen, Cranston has warmed the hearts of many with his commitment and love for his wife, Robin Dearden, whom he has been married to for decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/864c21ac0db7cfb1a002e6ab533ae5e0.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bryan Cranston at the opening night of "American Son" on November 04, 2018 | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Who is Dearden? What does she do? Where did she meet her husband? Read on to learn all the details about the woman who <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/343730/who-is-bryan-cranstons-wife-robin-dearden/>captured Cranston's heart.</a></p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DEARDEN IS AN ACTRESS</strong></p><p class=dh>Born on December 4, 1953, Dearden is also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0213142/>a successful movie star</a> in her own right. Best known for appearing in the 1980 series "Magnum, P.I.," she has undoubtedly made a name for herself.</p><p class=dh>However, while Cranston is still active in the film industry, Dearden is currently retired. She, however, never fails to support her husband, with whom she enjoys a blissful life.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MET ON A MOVIE SET</strong></p><p class=dh>Cranston and Dearden met in 1986 while appearing as guest stars on an episode of the television series "Airwolf," which the actor would later describe as a terrible TV show.</p><p class=dh>In the episode, Cranston acted as Robert Hollis, who <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/bryan-cranston-met-wife-robin-dearden-while-holding-her-captive-on-airwolf/>hijacked a school union</a>, taking Dearden's character hostage in the process. The pair kicked things off and soon forged a friendship.</p><p class=dh>However, while there was an undeniable attraction between Dearden and Cranston, they were both dating other people at the time. This allowed them to build a solid friendship infused with a little bit of flirting.</p><p class=dh>A year later, Dearden signed up for an acting class Cranston was taking. Like most actors in Hollywood, the duo greeted each other with a kiss.</p><p class=dh>It was, however, not the regular friendly on-the-cheek kiss as Cranston and Deardon locked lips for a sweet lingering kiss— the first of many for the couple.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DEARDEN PROPOSED IN A WEIRD WAY</strong></p><p class=dh>After dating for two and a half years, Cranston was sure he wanted to take their relationship to the next level. But a major problem was in the way he loved her.</p><p class=dh>The actor was so in love with Dearden that he believed he would break into tears if he proposed the conventional way. So he came up with a plan—a weird one at that.</p><p class=dh>While taking a bubble bath one day, Cranston and Dearden snuggled up against each other. The actor decided he would propose there but struggled with where to keep the ring. Then an idea came to him.</p><p class=dh>Cranston eventually put the ring on his baby toe and<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-bryan-cranston-awkward-proposal/> proposed to Dearden</a> with her soapy head turned to him. She said yes and picked the ring off the actor's toe.</p><p class=dh>Speaking about their unconventional proposal, Dearden described it as romantic but admitted she first thought to herself, "What the hell is this?"</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DEARDEN HAS A DAUGHTER</strong></p><p class=dh>Four years into their marriage, Dearden and Cranston welcomed Taylor, their first and only daughter. Unsurprisingly, she grew up with an interest in entertainment.</p><p class=dh>Today, Taylor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/361620/what-you-didnt-know-about-bryan-cranstons-daughter-taylor-dearden/>is a successful actress</a> in her own right. She made her acting debut in 2010 when she appeared alongside her dad in an episode of "Breaking Bad." She has long since appeared in shows like "Sweet/Vicious," a short-lived MTV series, and Netflix's "American Vandal."</p><p class=dh>Taylor has also had appearances in a bunch of TV pilots, including "Search and Destroy" and "To Whom It May Concern," both of which were not picked up for full series.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>STILL VERY IN LOVE</strong></p><p class=dh>Over three decades after getting married, Dearden and Cranston still remain as in love as when they first started their relationship.</p><p class=dh>Back in 2014, Cranston was asked what his favorite thing about Dearden was, to which the actor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2014/05/06/bryan-cranston-walter-white-robin-dearden-humans-of-new-york-fireflys/77276598/>answered that</a> he loves that his wife still gets giddy when she sees a firefly.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/22/bryan-cranston-when-not-feeling-happy-pretend>During an interview</a> in 2016, when asked who was the greatest love of his life, Cranton mentioned his wife. He also described their first kiss as the best of his life.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DEARDEN AND CRANSTON HAD COVID-19</strong></p><p class=dh>Shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic broke in 2020, Cranston and his wife were diagnosed with the virus. This came with many symptoms for the couple that lingered a lot longer, even after recovery.</p><p class=dh>Last December, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/bryan-cranston-opens-up-about-his-covid-19-experience-and-life-with-his-wife-robin/>Cranston opened up</a> about his COVID-19 experience, noting that his sense of taste and smell had not returned even after months of being free from the virus.</p><p class=dh>However, the actor said that he was grateful that his and Dearden's diagnosis was not serious, adding that they were very lucky to have recovered quickly.</p><p class=dh>With their COVID-19 days behind them, <a class="me a" href=#>Cranston</a> and Dearden can only look forward to what the future holds. As long as they have each other, this couple can weather any storm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmttaWxobHqzu8GipWaclZa%2FpbHNZqCsZZKnxqK6jJypmqajqbyvv4ysnJynnpl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f260487-robin-dearden-is-bryan-cranstons-second-html.html&text=Robin%20Dearden%20Is%20Bryan%20Cranston%27s%20Second%20Wife%20and%20Mom%20of%20His%20Only%20Daughter%20%20Facts%20about%20Her&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f260487-robin-dearden-is-bryan-cranstons-second-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f260487-robin-dearden-is-bryan-cranstons-second-html.html&title=Robin%20Dearden%20Is%20Bryan%20Cranston%27s%20Second%20Wife%20and%20Mom%20of%20His%20Only%20Daughter%20%20Facts%20about%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f260487-robin-dearden-is-bryan-cranstons-second-html.html&title=Robin%20Dearden%20Is%20Bryan%20Cranston%27s%20Second%20Wife%20and%20Mom%20of%20His%20Only%20Daughter%20%20Facts%20about%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f260487-robin-dearden-is-bryan-cranstons-second-html.html&title=Robin%20Dearden%20Is%20Bryan%20Cranston%27s%20Second%20Wife%20and%20Mom%20of%20His%20Only%20Daughter%20%20Facts%20about%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f260487-robin-dearden-is-bryan-cranstons-second-html.html&description=Robin%20Dearden%20Is%20Bryan%20Cranston%27s%20Second%20Wife%20and%20Mom%20of%20His%20Only%20Daughter%20%20Facts%20about%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tabasko-sweet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tabasko Sweet">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rihanna-all-black-outfit-rare-outing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rihanna Glows in Rare Public Outing After Giving Birth to Son">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
