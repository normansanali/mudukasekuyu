class=mol-para-with-font>Hannah said: ‘I was pretty much just going around as I felt like it – it was great having that freedom and not having to worry about going too far away from where I way staying because I could just stay wherever in my car.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I went to Cae Du Farm campsite in Rhoslefain for two nights, had breakfast at Tywyn beach then went to Portmeirion for the afternoon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Next I drove to a spot near Rhyd to park up for the night next to a woodland area and lake where I went for a walk in the morning.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Finally, I drove to Black Rock Sands and parked up on the beach for a few hours, went to Pistyll Rhaeadr waterfall and then home after.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hannah
