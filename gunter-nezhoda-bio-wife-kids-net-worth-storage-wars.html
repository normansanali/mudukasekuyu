According to TMZ, Gunther’s son Rene announced his death Tuesday night in his sleep in Utah as a consequence of complications from lung cancer in an emotional remembrance message.</p><p>Gunter was diagnosed with cancer in September 2022, and the chemotherapy he received had negative effects. Rene said his dad’s lungs had holes in them due to the treatment, so Gunter had flown to Utah recently in order to undergo emergency surgery. However, Rene claimed that doctors told his father it was too late and there was “nothing else they could do.”</p><p>Rene uploaded an emotional video on Instagram Wednesday in which he broke the news of his dad’s death and captioned it, “Very Sad day for the #storagewars #family #RIP #GunterNezhoda.” “My dad six months ago was diagnosed with lung cancer — he’s been smoking for 30 years,” he said in the clip. “He’s been smoking for a long time.”</p><p>“He was one of the guys on Storage Wars who never really got any hate,” Rene explained. “Everyone loved working with my dad.” At the time of his death, he was beside his youngest son Ricky Nezhoda. Rene noted that his family kept Gunter’s cancer battle private because they thought that he would “fully recover” but “unfortunately he didn’t.”</p><p>Gunter concluded, “All the love that you guys have shown and support, he really appreciates that, and now hopefully he’s now up there in heaven with my mom dancing again.”</p><p>Gunter appeared on a total of seven episodes of Storage Wars from 2015 to 2019 and according to sources he taped an episode with Rene for the future season.</p><h3><strong>Did Gunter Nezhoda Leave Behind A Wife?</strong></h3><p>No, Gunter Nezhoda didn’t leave behind a wife.

His oldest Rene is a reality television personality and entrepreneur. Rene was raised in Germany. He attended Las Vegas High School.</p><p>When he was just eleven years old, Rene began purchasing and selling antiques and collectibles. Since then, he has honed his skills in the field. When he took part in the reality television series “Storage Wars,” his extensive understanding of used goods proved to be quite beneficial.</p><p>His understanding of second-hand prices and haggling prowess helped him build a successful profession over the years, but it wasn’t until 2013 that he gained notoriety and became a household figure. Together with his wife, Rene joined the cast of the “Storage Wars” television show on the A&E network, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Rene is married to Casey, who appeared on the A&E network series with him. The couple is known to as “The Bargain Hunters” on the show and complimented each other fairly nicely.</p><p>Ricky Nezhoda is the youngest son of Gunter. He is currently 38 years old and is currently engaged to his fiance Elise. Ricky was by his father’s side at the last moment. Ricky took to his <a href=#>IG</a> after his dad’s death, and wrote, “This year has been really tough, but I will cherish the memories for a lifetime… Rest easy now Pops.”</p><h3><strong>How Much Was Gunter Nezhoda Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>According to several sources, Gunter Nezhoda’s net worth should be above $1 million. Gunter was a musician and actor. Starting out as a musician, he played bass alongside Pat Travers, Leslie West, Michael Schenker, George Lynch, Kevin Dubrow, and many others.</p><p>The TV celebrity was also an enthusiastic photographer, and big brands like Microsoft, Big-O Tires, Ford, and many more have exploited his work. His photographs are popular for their powerful effect and Gunter’s ability to capture any look on a subject’s face he chooses at precisely the correct time.</p><p>Gunther gave up music in 2005 to concentrate on TV appearances. He also had success in the movie business; he is best known for playing the character “Gus” in the Austrian comedy movie Die Edlseer. The White Ribbon, The Counterfeiter, Einstein, and Einstein are just a few of the international movies the actor has acted in.</p><h3><strong>Gunter Nezhoda Age At The Time Of His Death</strong></h3><p>Gunter Nezhoda was 67 years old at the time of his death.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Was Gunter Nezhoda On Instagram And Facebook?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Gunter Nezhoda was on <a href=#>IG</a>.
