And I have a wholesale bedding line that I manufacture here in Texas, that I sell through the markets and it’s called Moon Rein. It’s a custom bedding line, it’s really high end, and so I thought, well, why don’t I just sell my bedding as well at the wholesale market and sell other things and just have a boutique? And so that’s what I started. It’s downtown and so I also do my design business out of there as well.”</p><p>She also shared that her customers still recognize her from Trading Spaces. She said,</p><p>“People come in and they talk to me and say, ‘Oh my God we just miss watching everybody together and seeing the families.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kia_Steave-Dickerson></span><span><strong>Kia Steave-Dickerson:</strong> </span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kia was the designer of the show, Trading Spaces.

I just did design work…before the show, I worked in the film and television industry, but behind the camera, for years before I did Trading Spaces. I told my friend Kevin (an amazing prop master) who wanted me to come work on 30 Rock at the time, ‘You know Kevin, I can’t come work on 30 Rock. Maybe when my son turns 7 I’ll come back.’ Three weeks after my son turned seven, Kevin called me and said ‘Okay Kia, you gotta come work on the new Rocky movie. Your father worked on the first one and you may never get this opportunity again.'”</p><p>She added,</p><p>“I ended up working on Creed,&nbsp;not knowing that Rocky is now rebirthed and there’s a whole new generation of fans for the franchise. So I ended up working on Creed and from Creed that took me to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and I’ve just completed shooting the third season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt as the assistant prop master to Kevin Ladson. So yeah, I’m working with Tina Fey, who is also from Philadelphia, so we’re having a great time.”</p><p>You may like to read <a class=row-title href=# aria-label="“TV host of Trading Spaces Genevieve Gorder marries her beau Christian Dunbar in Morocco” (Edit)">TV host of Trading Spaces Genevieve Gorder marries her beau Christian Dunbar in Morocco</a></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Barry_Wood></span><span><strong>Barry Wood:</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BP_HREGE101H_Genevieve-Gorder-at-home-137903-399570.jpg.rend_.hgtvcom.1280.960.jpeg><p>Barry after starring in Trading Spaces from 2004 and 2007, was then seen on the HGTV show&nbsp;Hidden Potential.</p><p>He explains,</p><p>“I’m an architect and a construction manager so I am doing a great deal of work for the U.S. government actually on a lot of design and construction for a lot of different types of facilities like academic buildings, marine academy, a baseball field.

I think people forget that prior to Trading Spaces, design was only accessible to the top rung of the social ladder. Trading Spaces really drove the point home and it did it while entertaining people that design can change your life.
