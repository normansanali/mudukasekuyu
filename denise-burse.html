She was born on the <strong>13th of</strong> <strong>January 1952</strong> in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.</p><p>The theatre-turned-movie actress is also known to be vocal about her political beliefs as she has been in the past, especially during the <strong>2020 US presidential elections</strong>.</p><h2>Her Theater Works:</h2><p>Like many movie stars, Denise Burse also started her career at the theatres. She crafted her theatre skills from the <i>Just Us Theatre, The Alliance Theatre, </i>and <i>The Atlanta Children’s Theatre.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/14/denise%20theatre-1663150622992.jpg><p>Performing on <strong>Broadway</strong> is on the bucket list of every theatre-woven artist, and Denise has managed to do it on several occasions. She was also part of the critically acclaimed <strong>1997 Broadway production</strong> of <i>An American Daughter</i>. Despite establishing herself in movies, her heart will always be in theatre.</p><h2>About Denise's TV Works:</h2><p>What Denise lacks in movies, she makes up for it with her television works. She has worked in all sorts of genres on television which goes on to show her versatility as an actress.&nbsp;</p><p>Her most recognizable work on television is the role of <i>Claretha Jenkins </i>in the hit TV series <i>Tyler Perry’s House of Payne</i> and Elder Kelly in Netflix’s highly acclaimed <i>Black Mirror</i>.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Most people aren't aware that she has also featured in the iconic <i>Law and Order </i>series on three occasions. She also appeared as <i>Mrs. Henderson</i> in one episode of a now disliked figure in Hollywood <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bill Cosby</a>’s <i>The Cosby Show.</i></p><p>Apart from this, she has featured in other highly rated shows like <i>NBC’s Manifest, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey, The Annex, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, New Amsterdam</i>, and many other works.&nbsp;</p><h2>Her Movie Works:</h2><p>A significantly less portion of Denise's filmography is made up of movies. However, her first major break from the theatres came in the form of a big screen with the 1990 thriller film <i>Torment</i>. Unfortunately for her, the film was poorly received.&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to Theatre and Television, her movie catalog is not impressive, with her most identifiable work being the 1996 released crime drama <i>The Juror, </i>which had a lukewarm reception from the audience.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/15/deinise%20with%20friend-1663218628523.jpg><p>Her other identifiable works include<i> Basquiat; Funny Valentines; Preaching to the Choir; Peace, Love & Misunderstanding; Anesthesia,</i> with her 2021 release <i>Vacation Friends</i> being her most recent film as per IMDb.</p><h2>Net Worth & Earnings of Denise&nbsp;</h2><p>Denise Burse estimated net worth is believed to be around <strong>$3 million</strong>. Her primary income source is acting so most of her income comes from theatre, movies, and TV works.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being a millionaire, you won’t find her living a flashy lifestyle. If she has other sources from which she generates revenue, she has chosen not to reveal them.</p><h2>Who Is Denise's Partner In Crime?</h2><p>Denise Burse is in a happy and steady married life with a fellow actor <strong>Peter Jay Fernandez</strong>. They officially tied their knot on<strong> 9 April 1994</strong> and have been going strong. They have been together for over <strong>25 years</strong>, with both partners choosing not to have a baby.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/14/Denise%20with%20her%20husband-1663151412051.jpg><p>Regarding relationships, she is a bit reserved as she believes her personal life is of no one's interest. Furthermore, she hasn’t opened up about her past relations if she had been in one.&nbsp;</p><p>The romantic couple has hardly shared any details about their relationship. Both have decided it would be better to keep their relationship far away from the limelight.</p><h2>Special Bond With Samuel L. Jackson:&nbsp;</h2><p>The recent release of <strong>Samuel L. Jackson</strong>’s starrer, <i>The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,</i> led to people talking about the on-screen chemistry between Sam and Denise. Despite Sam being the protagonist, Denise stole the show with her excellent performance as the supporting actress.</p><p>She later revealed that Sam had recommended her name for the show. When they met at the shoot, Sam told her she was the first person in Sam's head as <i>Shirley Wring</i> when he had read the book the series was based on 12 years ago.</p><p>Very few know that their friendship dates way back. She has been friends with Sam and his wife, <strong>LaTanya Richardso</strong>n, for over 50 years. It was Sam's wife who introduced these two. Since then, Denise has been considered a part of their family and was even invited to their wedding.</p><h2>Denis’s&nbsp;Movies & TV Accolades:</h2><p>It’s not just the theatre that has recognized Denis’s talent but the world of television as well. Her acting prowess was finally recognized by television when the most significant TV award, <strong>the Emmys</strong>, awarded her for her work in the episode titled <strong>“San Junipero”</strong> from the hit series <i>Black Mirror.</i></p><p>She even has a star on the iconic <strong>Hollywood Walk of Fame</strong>. She received it in 2019 for playing Claretha Jerkins in <i>Tyler Perry's House of Payne</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/14/denise%20star-1663150992868.jpg><h2>Her Theater Accolades:</h2><p>Denis has been very vocal about her love for theatres. She has always preferred to do it over the big screen cinema. The theater is where she started her performing career, and she wouldn't mind just doing it for the rest of her life.</p><p>Her love and passion for the theatre were validated in her early days when she was awarded ''<strong>Theatre World Awards</strong>'' in 1990 for her performance in the play <i>Ground People</i><strong>.</strong></p><h2>Her Education & Majors:&nbsp;</h2><p>You would be surprised to know that acting is not the only thing Denise has crafted her skills on. She could pursue her education degree without letting her theatre and acting works act as some form of hindrance.</p><p>She is a movie actress with a degree in Psychology, just like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Billie Catherine Lourd</a>. She completed her <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Psychology</strong> and Theatre from <strong>Spelman College</strong> in her hometown Atlanta.</p><h2>Physical Stats: How Tall Is Denise?</h2><p>Denise stands tall with her, more than the average height of <strong>5 feet 9 inches</strong> (175 cm) which is tall for a woman as per Hollywood’s standards. She weighs in at <strong>68 kg</strong> (150 lbs).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/14/denise%20and%20lia%20chang-1663152258716.jpg><p>Her curvy body compliments her height and weight, with her waist measured at <strong>25 inches</strong> and hips measured at <strong>34 inches</strong>. As per dress size standards of the US, <strong>size 6</strong> is ideal for her body.</p><h2>Social Media Presence:</h2><p>One thing about Denise that many people aren't aware of is her love for volunteer work. She is ready to help any newcomers in the world of acting. She loves sharing her knowledge and experience with them and does this through <a href=# rel=nofollow>LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides LinkedIn, you can also find her on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Facebook</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a>. She, however, hardly uses these two platforms. She has very few followers on both these accounts, with the platforms yet to verify her accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>She isn’t too bothered by the lack of followers as she uses the power of social media to engage in political discussions. And unlike her life, she is open and vocal about her opinions on political matters.&nbsp;</p><h2>Denise Gets Political on Social Media:</h2><p>In the past, Denise has spoken about the Presidential election in which she urged all her followers to go and vote. She made everyone aware of what she felt about the then republican candidate <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p><p>You will also find her constantly bringing up the issues black people face in the present and the past. She talks about the overall welfare of the black community in America.</p><p>She has also made it clear how she feels about people who refused to wear masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. She also urged her followers to help those in need while staying safe.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Interested in more celebrity news like this?
