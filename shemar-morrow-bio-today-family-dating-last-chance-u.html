Just take a look at Shemar Morrow.&nbsp; This basketball fanatic, to continue playing the game, got adopted by one of his friend’s fathers, and also despite not being the best at academics secured a&nbsp; position assured at the </span><i><span>College of Alameda</span></i><span>. Today, he is a part of the ELAC basketball team featured on Netflix’s </span><i><span>Last Chance U: Basketball</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Learn more about him as this Shemar Morrow Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Shemar Morrow On Last Chance U: Basketball Season 2</b></h3><p><span>Netflix’s </span><i><span>Last Chance U: Basketball</span></i><span> followed the basketball team of</span><i><span> East Los Angeles College </span></i><span>(ELAC). They were once a team struggling to win any match, and it was only after the arrival of Head coach John Mosley, the players showed the world exactly what they are made of.</span></p><p><span>Now, the show’s already in its season 2 and Shemar Morrow, who never expected to be a part of the Huskies, is still scoring wins for the team.</span></p><p><span>The basketball star, Shemar started his basketball career at </span><i><span>La Mirada High School</span></i><span>. However, he soon became affiliated with </span><i><span>Shadow Mountain High School</span></i><span> from Phoenix, Arizona, and it was also there he gained his much-deserved fame thanks to his impressive basketball skills.</span></p><p><span>Later, Shemar was chosen to participate in the 2016 USA Basketball Men’s Junior National Team October minicamp — an experience Shemar cherishes as one of his achievements.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, more focused on games Shemar couldn’t obtain his high school diploma as his grades which were apparently not sufficient. However, he did secure a position at the </span><i><span>College of Alameda</span></i><span>, C.A.</span></p><p><span>Finally, in 2021, Shemar joined the ELAC Huskies, something he never dreamed of. But now that he’s in, the basketball player is set on forging a path ahead and continuing his passion for basketball.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>His life as featured on </span><i><span>Last Chance U: Basketball</span></i><span> was definitely far from easy. It got many wondering, why the star wasn’t made to play often.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Also, featured alongside Shemar were Head Coach John Mosley, Coach Rob Robinson, Coach Ken Hunter, Brandon Wilson, Bryan Penn-Johnson, Demetrius “DC” Calipi II, Josh Phillips, Damani Whitlock, Dezmond Washington, Justin Gladney, and DJ Gilmore.</span></p><h3><b>Where Is Shemar Morrow Today?</b></h3><p><span>Today, as of December 2022, Shemar Morrow is still playing for ELAC Huskies. In fact, he is one of the major players for the 2022-2023 season.</span></p><p><span>Prior to this season, Shemar played a total of 22 games and scored an average of 4.1 points in each match in the 2021-2022 season. Reportedly, his Field Goal Percentage was an impressive 53.5%.</span></p><p><span>Even when writing this article, Shemar already had 8 official games of the 2022-2023 season with 6 wins and 2 losses. The two defeats came on November 13, and December 2, while ELAC was paired against </span><i><span>West Los Angeles College</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fullerton College</span></i><span>, respectively.</span></p><p><span>As for their victories, ELAC won all three of their games in the Riverside City Tournament.</span></p><p><span>Besides basketball, Shemar is now also focused on gaining his GED.</span></p><p><span>It seems Shemar will also be eligible for the 2024 NBA Draft.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Back in 2014, when Shemar was only in sixth grade, he made headlines throwing a dunk during a game that went to double overtime. He also dropped 53 points in that game earning himself the name “Baby LeBron.”</span></p><h3><b>Shemar Morrow Family</b></h3><p><span>Shemar Morrow grew up in East Cleveland, Ohio with his biological family. But since they were struggling, Shemar’s mother Sharay D Morrow (born: November 1974), allowed one of Shemar’s friend’s fathers to adopt him so that he could continue playing the game.</span></p><p><span>After that, Shemar with his adoptive family moved to Sacramento, California.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, we don’t have info on Shemar’s father or siblings.</span></p><h3><b>Shemar Morrow Age</b></h3><p><span>Shemar Morrow was 21 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He was one of the youngest players on the </span><i><span>East Los Angeles College </span></i><span>basketball team.</span></p><h3><b>Is Shemar Morrow Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Shemar Morrow didn’t reveal his dating life. But if you ask us, the basketball star was more focused on his career and studies rather than building his love life.
