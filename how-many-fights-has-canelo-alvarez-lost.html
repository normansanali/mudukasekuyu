His achievements include unified titles in three weight classes and lineal titles in two.</p><p>Notably, <a href=# rel=noopener>Álvarez</a> holds the distinction of being the first and only boxer in history to become the undisputed champion at super middleweight. Since 2020, he has held the WBA (Super), WBC, and Ring magazine titles in this weight division, and since 2021, he has also held the IBF and WBO titles.</p><p>Renowned for his boxing prowess, Canelo Álvarez is widely recognized for his exceptional counterpunching skills. He has a remarkable ability to exploit openings in his opponents’ defenses while simultaneously avoiding incoming punches through adept head and body movement.</p><p>Additionally, he is highly regarded for his proficiency as a body puncher, delivering devastating blows to his opponents’ midsections. These attributes have solidified his reputation as a formidable and versatile fighter.</p><p>As of May 2022, Canelo Álvarez is widely regarded as the best active pound-for-pound boxer in the world. This accolade is supported by rankings from esteemed organizations such as BoxRec and the Boxing Writers Association of America.</p><p>Furthermore, he holds high rankings by ESPN, The Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB), and The Ring magazine. Álvarez’s remarkable skill set has earned him recognition as the top active super middleweight boxer by BoxRec, The Ring, TBRB, and ESPN.</p><p>Canelo Álvarez was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, and at the age of five, his family relocated to Juanacatlán, Jalisco, where they currently reside.</p><p>Growing up on the family farm, Canelo Álvarez developed a passion for horseback riding, a hobby he continues to enjoy. He is the youngest of eight siblings, all of whom are boys, and it is worth noting that each of his brothers has pursued a career in professional boxing.</p><p>Notable among them are his brothers Ramón Álvarez and Ricardo Álvarez, who compete in the welterweight division, as well as his brother Rigoberto Álvarez, a former WBA interim world champion.</p><p>The nickname “Canelo” is derived from the Spanish word for cinnamon, which interestingly enough is often used as a nickname for individuals with red hair. Álvarez acquired this nickname due to his striking red hair, a trait he shares with his mother, Ana Maria.</p><p>In Mexico, there is a historical association between red hair and the Irish soldiers who fought for Mexico during the Mexican–American War as part of the Saint Patrick’s Battalion. Álvarez has mentioned the possibility of having Irish ancestry, stating, “There might have been an Irish grandfather somewhere back in my past.”</p><p>As a child, Álvarez faced bullying and derogatory remarks, being referred to as “Jícama con Chile,” which translates to jicama with chili flakes, a popular snack in Mexico.</p><p>Santos Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez Barragán’s journey from a young boy on a farm to one of the most accomplished boxers in the world is a testament to his dedication, skill, and resilience. His remarkable achievements and unique background have made him an icon in the sport of boxing, inspiring countless fans around the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many fights has Canelo Álvarez lost?</h2><p>Canelo Álvarez has lost two professional fights.
