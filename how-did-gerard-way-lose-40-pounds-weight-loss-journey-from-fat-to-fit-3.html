He had low confidence in presenting himself in front of his audience because of his heavy body, and he felt ashamed of his size, somewhere inside, which is not a unique thing to know.</p><figure></figure><p>He has chosen to stay silent about his weight loss process. Still, we believe he indulged in the limited diet properly, for a specific duration, and he must have regularly exercised and worked out to reduce his body weight. Determination is an important key for any person to carry out any work; we believe the key to his success must have been his self-belief, hard work, and perseverance towards the work.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-supportive-are-the-family-of-gerard-way></span>How Supportive Are The Family Of Gerard Way?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gerard Way got into the music because of the support from his family and especially from his parents.</p><p>He is the son of Donna Lee and Donald Way, who were of Italian and Scottish descent, respectively, and from this, we can understand that he possesses a mixed ethnicity. Alongside, he also had a brother, Mikey, who also happens to be a famous musician, and the childhood of these brothers must have been going pretty well.</p><p>Today, we can find them thankful for everything their parents have done for them, and they are repaying their parents’ debts by creating even more popular names among people.</p><p>Relevant:&nbsp;Taylour Paige and Kendrick Lamar Collaboration, Meet The Newest Rapper In Town Making Her Debut</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=find-gerard-way-on-the-instagram></span>Find Gerard Way On The Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gerard Way is available on Instagram under&nbsp;@gerardway, and he has got millions of followers who are impressed by his songs.</p><p>We can find him frequently sharing pictures relating to his musical career, but we can rarely find pictures about himself, which shows his quite different personality type.</p><p>Apart from Instagram, he is present on Facebook at&nbsp;Gerard Way, and from this active social media participation, we can understand he prefers interaction with his fans and followers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqltcNmnp6qkaexbsPAsmSlp6OaenV8jKmmrqaUqHq4scign61lnKTAtHnJqKyrppWueqe%2BzqZkn5mkYsGwecWiq2ZrXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-gerard-way-lose-40-pounds-weight-loss-journey-from-fat-to-fit-3.html&text=How%20Did%20Gerard%20Way%20Lose%2040%20Pounds%3f%20Weight%20Loss%20Journey%20From%20Fat%20To%20Fit&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-gerard-way-lose-40-pounds-weight-loss-journey-from-fat-to-fit-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-gerard-way-lose-40-pounds-weight-loss-journey-from-fat-to-fit-3.html&title=How%20Did%20Gerard%20Way%20Lose%2040%20Pounds%3f%20Weight%20Loss%20Journey%20From%20Fat%20To%20Fit" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-did-gerard-way-lose-40-pounds-weight-loss-journey-from-fat-to-fit-3.html&title=How%20Did%20Gerard%20Way%20Lose%2040%20Pounds%3f%20Weight%20Loss%20Journey%20From%20Fat%20To%20Fit" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-gerard-way-lose-40-pounds-weight-loss-journey-from-fat-to-fit-3.html&title=How%20Did%20Gerard%20Way%20Lose%2040%20Pounds%3f%20Weight%20Loss%20Journey%20From%20Fat%20To%20Fit" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-gerard-way-lose-40-pounds-weight-loss-journey-from-fat-to-fit-3.html&description=How%20Did%20Gerard%20Way%20Lose%2040%20Pounds%3f%20Weight%20Loss%20Journey%20From%20Fat%20To%20Fit" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./linda-palonen-wwe-wrestler-apollo-crews-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Linda Palonen Wife of Apollo Crews">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heres-what-fans-are-saying-about-netflixs-choose-or-die-reviews.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's What Fans Are Saying About Netflix's 'Choose Or Die'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
