At all promotional events, the idol was seen with a curvier-than-usual waist. Furthermore, with the publication of the paparazzi photos, people began to speculate that ITZY’s Yuna was undergoing body alterations for aesthetic reasons. Her face features and figure have often been commended. Her actress-like atmosphere has always drawn attention and distinguished her from the rest.</p><p>However, people chastised the idol for attempting to alter her genuine body shape. Simultaneously, many followers came up to defend the idol for her decision and instead advocated for less surveillance of celebrities.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>i couldn’t care less tbh BUT hip pads just look weird in general and the thing is yuna is known for having a pretty body so i think ppl just don’t get it. also it brings unwanted attention (i’m guessing) to her hips and shape so what is the point.. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/BbB09guAIX</a></p><p>— milo (@yoonjimsi) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2022</a></p><h2>Yuna of ITZY has been chastised for allegedly wearing hip padding.</h2><p>Netizens recently chastised ITZY’s Yuna for allegedly using butt pads to make her waist seem curvier. Netizens chastised ITZY’s Yuna for attempting to change her body image when she is already fairly attractive. Some argue that such a move sets unreasonable attractiveness standards for fans.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ITZYs-Yuna-1-1.jpg alt="ITZY's Yuna" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, several netizens defended ITZY’s Yuna, arguing that she had every right to wear whatever made her feel secure. After all, it all boils down to personal preference. The audience is equally responsible for helping K-pop stars feel secure in expressing their genuine selves.&nbsp;The public, according to the netizens, should stop commenting on and paying attention to every small aspect of the idols’ bodies and instead concentrate on their songs and work.</p><h2>K-pop is notorious for its unrealistic beauty standards.</h2><p>K-pop is infamous for having unrealistic beauty standards that border on the impossible. Female idols, who are supposed to be the ideal of perfection at all times, seem to face even tougher norms.&nbsp;Aside from huge eyes, a petite face with a v-line jaw, a high nose bridge, and plump big lips, the unrealistic standards also require them to have exceedingly thin bodies, ideally with an hourglass form.</p><p>Women in South Korea who do not have a naturally voluptuous shape are sometimes urged to wear implants to boost their self-esteem. This is a frequent practice in the K-pop music business, where female stars are nearly obliged to wear breast and hip padding to seem attractive during stage performances and music videos.&nbsp;Several former K-pop trainees have come out to admit that they were compelled to wear such modifications, which were not only uncomfortable and inconvenient but also harmful in the long term.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ITZYs-Yuna-2-1.jpg alt="ITZY's Yuna" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Not to mention that their self-esteem was so low that they couldn’t go out without turning to these improvements.&nbsp;Christine Park, a former member of the now-defunct K-pop group Blady, once said that female idols required to have a “glamorous physique or a very voluptuous figure,” and that breast pads and hip padding were a “must.” She further said,</p><p>“Every time we were on stage, we’d either wear certain bra pads or hip pads to essentially improve our bodies, and yeah, it’s terrible because when I’d return home and take off all the bra and butt pads, I felt extremely dissatisfied with my body and unconfident.”</p><p>ITZY made his JYP Entertainment debut in 2019 and was named Monster Rookies of the Era. Their performance of their first song “Dalla Dalla” was so amazing that they got their first broadcast station music program in a record-breaking 11 days and won on MNET’s M! Countdown in only 9 days.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I’m just gonna be honest – the prevalence of hip pads in kpop is seriously absurd. The pads are getting bigger and the girls are getting skinnier. They want girls to have a bmi under 18 with BBL hips, and they know it isn’t physically possible, so out come the pads.</p><p>— guroᵝ 🌎🐝 (@kimheech_on) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 18, 2022</a></p><p>The single’s music video also received a record 24 million views, the highest for any K-pop group debut.&nbsp;CHECKMATE marks ITZY’s best amount of stock pre-orders for an album to date, but it is also just the fourth female group album in history to achieve 700,000 stock pre-orders. aespa’s Girls, BLACKPINK’s THE ALBUM, and TWICE’s Formula of Love: O+T=3 were the only female groups to accomplish this accomplishment.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrbKpqHq6wc2aZKKrXZeyqrrGZpqroaSesKrGxJ1kn6eiYsK0tc2gZKGhoGKvsLvSraCnn12lrqW%2FjJqrZqyYmnq1tcyeZKieXaW%2FsLnOraCopl8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fitzys-yuna-is-being-criticized-for-using-hip-boosting-pads-at-the-time-of-promotion.html&text=ITZYs%20Yuna%20Is%20Being%20Criticized%20For%20Using%20Hip%20Boosting%20Pads%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20Promotion&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fitzys-yuna-is-being-criticized-for-using-hip-boosting-pads-at-the-time-of-promotion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fitzys-yuna-is-being-criticized-for-using-hip-boosting-pads-at-the-time-of-promotion.html&title=ITZYs%20Yuna%20Is%20Being%20Criticized%20For%20Using%20Hip%20Boosting%20Pads%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20Promotion" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fitzys-yuna-is-being-criticized-for-using-hip-boosting-pads-at-the-time-of-promotion.html&title=ITZYs%20Yuna%20Is%20Being%20Criticized%20For%20Using%20Hip%20Boosting%20Pads%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20Promotion" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fitzys-yuna-is-being-criticized-for-using-hip-boosting-pads-at-the-time-of-promotion.html&title=ITZYs%20Yuna%20Is%20Being%20Criticized%20For%20Using%20Hip%20Boosting%20Pads%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20Promotion" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fitzys-yuna-is-being-criticized-for-using-hip-boosting-pads-at-the-time-of-promotion.html&description=ITZYs%20Yuna%20Is%20Being%20Criticized%20For%20Using%20Hip%20Boosting%20Pads%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20Promotion" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mark-milovatage-wiki-biography-girlfriend-net-worth-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark MilovatAge, Wiki, Biography, girlfriend, Net Worth, Instagram">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heather-clem.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heather Clem, Bubba Ex matar | Kaset in jima'i da aka leka, Tarihin Rayuwa da Labarin Saki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
