Chip, the son of former US president Jimmy Carter lost his mother, the former First Lady Rosalynn Carter in 2023.</p><p>Rosalynn brought the performing arts front and center for the country as First Lady. Leading classical performers from all around the world as well as traditional American artists were welcomed to the White House by her. She also showed a keen interest in initiatives that support the community, the elderly, and mental health. She was the Honorary Chairperson of the President’s Commission on Mental Health from 1977 to 1978.</p><p>Rosalynn started the yearly Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy in 1985. In 1991, Rosalynn Carter and Betty Bumpers, the wife of Arkansas senator Dale Bumpers at the time, co-founded Every Child By Two, a national initiative to support childhood vaccinations. She was a member of The Atlanta Project’s policy advisory board from 1991 to 1999. The Atlanta Project is a Carter Center initiative that tackles the socioeconomic issues related to poverty and the standard of living in the Atlanta region. Mrs. Carter received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999, and the National Women’s Hall of Fame recognized her two years later.</p><p>How old is Becky now? What job does she do? Does she have any kids?</p><h3><strong>Meet Becky Payne, Chip Carter Wife</strong></h3><p>Chip Carter, one of the children of Jimmy Carter and the late Rosalynn Carter, is reportedly married to Becky Payne, his third wife. They <a href=#>reportedly</a> married in 2001.</p><p>On June 23, 1973, Chip tied the knot with Caron Griffin, whom he had first encountered three years prior while supporting his father’s bid for Georgia governor. According to the Washington Post, Chip left the White House in August 1977 amid rumors that he and Caron were divorcing. According to the Post, he and Caron divorced in 1980. Later on, he wed Ginger Hodges.</p><p>Jimmy and Rosalynn’s second son, James Earl “Chip” Carter III, was born in Honolulu on April 12, 1950. Jimmy had been serving in the Navy and was based in the capital of Hawaii at the time. Chip told the University of Georgia in 2008 that he attended the neighborhood public schools, worked in the family peanut warehouse, and then was elected to the Plains city council. He also served on the Democratic National Committee.</p><p>Chip was elected president of Friendship Force, an international exchange program co-founded by his parents, in 2000. Jimmy Carter disclosed in the documentary Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President that he, Willie Nelson, and Chip had indulged in marijuana use on the White House rooftop. Chip claimed to GQ in 2015 that Nelson instructed him to keep it a secret.</p><p>Rosalynn Carter, Chip’s mom, and wife of former president Jimmy Carter, died at the age of 96. Two days after the former first lady at the couple’s Plains, Georgia, home was placed under hospice care, the Carter Center declared her death. Rosalynn leaves behind a legacy of mental health activism together with her husband, four daughters, twenty-two grandchildren, and twenty-one great-grandchildren.</p><p>Jimmy Carter, 99, who is also in hospice care, paid tribute to his wife in the Carter Center statement, saying: “Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.”</p><p>A modest woman with a gentle smile and a gentler Southern accent, she was a devout Baptist and a mother of four. The “magnolia” was that. She also had a significant role in Jimmy Carter’s ascent from peanut farmer to 1976 presidential nominee. The “steel” was that. Rosalynn Carter was the 39th president’s closest confidante, best friend, and business and political partner during their more than 77 years of marriage, until her death on Sunday at the age of 96.</p><p>Chip after Rosalynn’s death said: “Besides being a loving mother and extraordinary First Lady, my mother was a great humanitarian in her own right. Her life of service and compassion was an example for all Americans. She will be sorely missed not only by our family but by the many people who have better mental health care and access to resources for caregiving today.”</p><h3><strong>Becky Payne And Chip Carter Kids</strong></h3><p>Becky Payne and Chip Carter don’t share any children. But they were parents to two children James Earl IV and Margaret Alicia.</p><p>James was born on February 25, 1977, and he is 46 years old. Margaret turned 36 on 23 September 2023.</p><h3><strong>Becky Payne Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1951, Becky Payne turned 72 years old in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Becky Payne Parents?</strong></h3><p>Details surrounding Becky Payne’s parents are not available on public records.</p><h3><strong>Becky Payne Job</strong></h3><p>There are no details regarding Becky Payne’s job and career.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Becky Payne From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Becky Payne is residing in Decatur, Georgia.
