As a result, it is pretty messed up that the press treats it like entertainment immediately after a celebrity couple breaks up. However, most people have to admit that when they see an article that is focused on <a href=#>celebrity couples that recently broke up</a>, they are bound to click on it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to <strong><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a></strong> and Katie Holmes’ relationship, however, it makes a lot more sense that the tabloids were obsessed as soon as they learned the couple was splitting. After all, the couple’s relationship largely took place in the public, with Cruise infamously professing his love for Holmes on Oprah and the pair constantly showing up on red carpets together. With that in mind, nobody should resent people for them being interested in <a href=#>what went on in Holmes’ life following her divorce from Cruise</a>. Even though the press breathlessly covered every aspect of Cruise and Holmes’ relationship, however, a lot of people have no idea what led to their split.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Things Katie Holmes Has Done Since Her Divorce From Tom Cruise</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-39-relationship-history>Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes' Relationship History</h2><p>Before and after Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes became a couple, got married, and had a child together, both of them dated other stars. For example, before Holmes got involved with Cruise, she was in relationships with American Pie actor Chris Klein and her former Dawson’s Creek co-star Joshua Jackson. On top of those relationships, <a href=#>Holmes dated Jamie Foxx</a> for several years following her divorce and it is safe to say that people were fascinated by their time as a couple.</p><p>For his part, Tom Cruise has been linked to a long list of major female stars. For example, Cruise was involved with Cher, Mimi Rogers, Rebecca De Mornay, and Heather Locklear early in his career. Then, Cruise fell for Nicole Kidman and they wound up being married from 1990 until 2001. Following Cruise and Kidman’s divorce, he dated Penelope Cruz for several years and was briefly linked to Sofia Vergara before he and Katie Holmes got together. Since Holmes and Cruise’s divorce, there have been rumors that Tom has dated the model Olga Kurylenko and the actors Laura Prepon and Hayley Atwell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Women Tom Cruise Has Dated (10 Who Wouldn't Dare)</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-cruise-goes-on-the-record-about-his-and-katie-39-s-divorce>Tom Cruise Goes On The Record About His And Katie's Divorce</h2><p>Following Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ divorce, there were loads of publications that were competing to have the most eye-catching headline about the situation. As it turns out, that wasn’t a great financial decision by the publications involved as Cruise has proven to be happy to take people and publications to court. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise sued Bauer Media, the company that owns Life & Style and In Touch, for $50 million</a> after they published an article claiming he’d abandoned his 6-year-old daughter Suri.</p><p>Once Tom Cruise sued Bauer Media, the defendant was entitled to the discovery process. Since the whole reason why the lawsuit began is an article claiming that Cruise had abandoned his daughter, that allowed Bauer Media’s lawyers to force Tom to sit for a deposition. Soon after Cruise was forced to answer Bauer Media’s lawyers’ questions, RadarOnline acquired a transcript of the conversation and it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed the reason behind Tom and Katie’s divorce</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Early on in the deposition, a lawyer for Bauer Media asked Tom Cruise if Katie Holmes divorced him "in part to protect Suri from Scientology". Given Cruise’s well-known belief in and passion for Scientology, it isn’t surprising that Tom called that question “offensive” before saying "there is no need to protect my daughter from my religion”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Tom Cruise Still Talk To His Daughter Suri Since Splitting With Katie Holmes?</a></span></p><p>If Tom Cruise was able to dictate the rules of the deposition, as he can with most interviews, the line of questioning about Scientology certainly would have been dropped at that point. In fact, it wouldn’t have been brought up in the first place. However, Cruise wasn’t in charge which allowed Bauer Media’s lawyers to continue pressing the topic. Surprisingly enough, it didn’t take long for Cruise to make a notable admission. After all, when Cruise was asked a second time if Holmes’ desire to protect Suri from Scientology inspired their divorce, he was shockingly forthright. "Did she say that? That was one of the assertions, yes." Later in the same deposition, Cruise stated that his daughter Suri no longer was practicing Scientology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Tom Cruise’s admission about Scientology’s role in his divorce from Katie Holmes, some people may conclude that his religion was solely responsible for their split. In reality, however, that seems naïve since relationships are far too complicated to believe that a couple divorced for one reason only. Still, Cruise’s statements do make it clear that Scientology at the very least played a major role in the divorce.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's Why Katie Holmes Refused To Leave Her House After Her And Tom Cruise Split</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledOopGaboqq2tLGMmqWdZZuWwaqxjKGmpaWVqHq0vMuiq2ark56yr8DOpaagsV2owrO1jKucpZmknryvv8eip2ZqYGd%2BcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-split-scientology-suri-relationship-2021.html&text=This%20Is%20What%20Destroyed%20Tom%20Cruise%20And%20Katie%20Holmes%27%20Relationship%2c%20According%20To%20Him&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-split-scientology-suri-relationship-2021.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-split-scientology-suri-relationship-2021.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Destroyed%20Tom%20Cruise%20And%20Katie%20Holmes%27%20Relationship%2c%20According%20To%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-split-scientology-suri-relationship-2021.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Destroyed%20Tom%20Cruise%20And%20Katie%20Holmes%27%20Relationship%2c%20According%20To%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-split-scientology-suri-relationship-2021.html&title=This%20Is%20What%20Destroyed%20Tom%20Cruise%20And%20Katie%20Holmes%27%20Relationship%2c%20According%20To%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-split-scientology-suri-relationship-2021.html&description=This%20Is%20What%20Destroyed%20Tom%20Cruise%20And%20Katie%20Holmes%27%20Relationship%2c%20According%20To%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-crabtree-and-evelyn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Crabtree And Evelyn?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./these-domain-6-reactions-to-zayns-pink-suit-at-the-grammys-prove-fans-are-in-love-with-his-colorful-look-8041959.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These Twitter Reactions To Zayns Pink Suit At The Grammys Prove Fans Are In Love With His Colorfu">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
