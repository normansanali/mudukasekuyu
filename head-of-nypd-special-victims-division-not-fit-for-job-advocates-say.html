Just weeks ago Chief of Department Rodney Harrison <a href=#>dressed him down</a> in a closed-door meeting for shoddy paperwork in the unit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/svu-logo.jpg><p>Advocates did concede reform is a high bar in the small beleaguered division without support from the top and hope a new administration brings change.</p><p>“Any commanding officer is being set up to fail until they are given adequate staff, adequate experienced detective and adequate,” said Jane Manning, the director of the Women’s Equal Justice Project.</p><p>Mary Haviland, the former executive director at New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault, added there has been a “real investigative brain drain since [Michael] Osgood” <a href=#>was forced out</a>.</p><p>“Neither Judith Harrison nor Michael King was a detective and neither has deep investigative skills,” Haviland said.</p><p>Those issues, advocates say, are just the latest addition to a lengthy list of unchanged systemic issues in the unit that were exemplified on Monday when rape survivors emotionally recounted their disturbing interactions with investigators to the New York City Council members.</p><p>One victim went as far as to say that her interaction with an SVD investigator was worse than the sexual assault itself. Another said she found out she was pregnant before an investigator followed up with her.</p><p>In a shocking revelation, one woman recounted to the council that a sergeant had dismissed her rape claim because she was sleeping when it started. He then went on to casually admit that “he has sex with his wife while she’s asleep and she’s not reporting him for rape.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/inspector-michael-king.jpg><p>Haviland — who asked the Department of Justice to open a probe into the NYPD’s SVD unit this summer — said that those “old-fashioned, outmoded” perception of sex assaults is a hurdle the department must overcome — but it isn’t unique to the rank-and-file.</p><p>“I can’t say how many times those stereotypes have been mentioned in meetings with commissioners,” said Haviland, adding that it shows in the lack of resources the “the NYPD attributes to these crimes.”</p><p>During one meeting in 2019, she recalled to The Post, then-Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea tried to write off filling the unit with low-level officers instead of trained investigators.</p><p>“What you need is heart and passion,” she recalled the now-Police Commissioner saying in pitching the inexperienced investigators as a positive step.</p><p>“He should have been promoting the skills of detectives,” Haviland said.</p><p>Shea claimed back in 2018 he spearheaded reforms in the unit as the city’s top detectives <a href=#>after a scathing Department of Investigations report</a>, but advocates say much of what was done was a shell game, shifting resources from child abuse cases to adult sexual assault units.</p><p>And advocates now believe the effects of that shift this year are being seen in the uptick of child deaths.</p><p>Manning, who is also a former sex crimes prosecutor, said the lack of reforms all falls to the leadership at the highest levels of the department.</p><p>“There is someone that can fix the ongoing failures of the SVD and that person is Police Commissioner Dermot Shea,” said Manning.</p><p>Both Haviland and Manning said they hope for a nationwide search for a new head of SVD.</p><p>“I want to hear the mayoral candidates&nbsp;explain what they will demand of their police commissioner when it comes to repairing NYPD response to sexual assault,” she said.</p><p>In a statement, police spokesman Sgt. Edward Riley said the department “is committed to ensuring that all sexual assault survivors feel the safety and support needed to come forward.’</p><p>“Special Victims Unit investigators bring a victim-centric and evidence-driven approach and work tirelessly to build the strongest possible case,” Riley said.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmJqupXnOn2SnsaCZerS8xJygmqRdq7akwMimqmacmau2tLXOp2Snp6Ris6rAjJ%2Bmq2WapK9urcOvppyZpJrAbr%2FAsmY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhead-of-nypd-special-victims-division-not-fit-for-job-advocates-say.html&text=Head%20of%20NYPD%20Special%20Victims%20Division%20not%20fit%20for%20job%2c%20advocates%20say&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhead-of-nypd-special-victims-division-not-fit-for-job-advocates-say.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhead-of-nypd-special-victims-division-not-fit-for-job-advocates-say.html&title=Head%20of%20NYPD%20Special%20Victims%20Division%20not%20fit%20for%20job%2c%20advocates%20say" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhead-of-nypd-special-victims-division-not-fit-for-job-advocates-say.html&title=Head%20of%20NYPD%20Special%20Victims%20Division%20not%20fit%20for%20job%2c%20advocates%20say" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhead-of-nypd-special-victims-division-not-fit-for-job-advocates-say.html&title=Head%20of%20NYPD%20Special%20Victims%20Division%20not%20fit%20for%20job%2c%20advocates%20say" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhead-of-nypd-special-victims-division-not-fit-for-job-advocates-say.html&description=Head%20of%20NYPD%20Special%20Victims%20Division%20not%20fit%20for%20job%2c%20advocates%20say" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./justin-jesso-net-worth-294096.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Jesso Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./fortune-magazine-bizarrely-slams-ice-cube-takes-swipe-at-hip-hop-music.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fortune magazine bizarrely slams Ice Cube, takes swipe at hip-hop music">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
