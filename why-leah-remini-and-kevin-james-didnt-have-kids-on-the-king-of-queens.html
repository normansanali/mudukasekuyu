However, as it turns out, that was no coincidence. In fact, the show's creators specifically opted not to show the Heffernans become parents.</p><p>So, what was the reason?</p><p><strong>Updated October 3, 2023:</strong> More than a decade on since The King of Queens aired its final episode, Leah Remini and Kevin James have continued to stay friends, and gushed over the impact the show had on their lives. In fact, in late September, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">both took to Instagram to share sweet tributes to their time on the show</a>.

With the comedic antics of the trio, some might wonder why the couple Doug and Carrie never had kids along the way - especially since by the end of the show's run, they'd been married for years.</p><p>Although it's no big deal that the couple ended up not having kids of their own, it turns out that storyline did not come from the show's writers. Instead, it was decided by the studio.</p><p>Speaking to The Futon Critic, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">executive producer of the show, David Bickel gave a few reasons as to why that was the case</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For starters, he explained, there tends to be a perception amongst audiences that characters having a baby creates something of a life raft for the show, and even gives the impression that writers are out of other ideas.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="Patton Oswalt Went Off Script And Trolled The King Of Queens By Not Moving An Inch During An Entire Scene">Leah Remini Took An Aggressive Approach To Her New King Of Queens Deal With CBS, And Got Kevin James Type Money Because Of It</a></span></p><p>There was also a pragmatic reason, on the network's end. That was, having seasons set "pre-baby" and "post-baby," was likely to impact syndication of the show.</p><p>Most hilariously, though, Bicket joked that for many viewers, there already was a baby figure in the cast: Carrie's father, Arthur.</p><p>Sure enough, Arthur Heffernan was known for his childish antics throughout the show's run, so adding an actual baby into the mix would have undoubtedly have changed the dynamic fans knew and loved so well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-constant-fighting-of-doug-and-carrie-might-have-contributed-to-this-decision>The Constant Fighting Of Doug And Carrie Might Have Contributed To This Decision</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/still-of-leah-remini-and-kevin-james.jpg><p>As anyone who so much as drifted in and out of watching The King of Queens will know, one of the hallmarks of the show was Doug and Carrie's tempestuous relationship. To say the two fought like cats and dogs would be an understatement, at best.</p><p>However, it's for precisely that reason that them getting their baby when they did made for a full-circle moment for the couple.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow title="The Real Reason For Leah Remini's Sudden Weight Gain On The King Of Queens">King Of Queens Absolutely Pushed The Envelope With These Controversial Episodes That Simply Wouldn't Fly Today</a></span></p><p>As fans will remember, the show ended with Carrie and Doug finally adopting a baby girl - though, while en route to China to get her, they'd recently split up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while aboard the plane, they ultimately reconciled, and even addressed some of the issues they'd faced throughout their marriage, leading up to that point.</p><p>Staying true to form, though, of course there were also copious references to Arthur's childish antics while Carrie was growing up.</p><h2 id=kevin-james-and-leah-remini-39-s-portrayal-affected-their-off-screen-relationship>Kevin James And Leah Remini's Portrayal Affected Their Off-Screen Relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/leah-remini-with-kevin-james-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another possible reason why the network decided adding a baby to the mix might not have been a great idea? After years of working together, Kevin James and Leah Remini's relationship off-camera relationship had begun to look a lot like that of their characters.</p><p>As Leah -- who had <a href=# rel=nofollow>accepted the project without reading the script</a> -- revealed in an episode of Oprah's Where Are They Now?, she and Kevin had a bunch of ups and downs over the years.</p><p>In fact, she joked that sometimes, even when their characters had made up, they weren't on great terms, themselves.</p><p>"There were times when <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kevin and I would argue about something really stupid and we had to kiss ... but we would make no eye contact</a>," she shared, breaking into a slight smile.</p><p>However, in the same interview, she smiled that that was simply because they cared about each other just as much as Doug and Carrie did.</p><p>As Leah continued, "You know, if you don't care about somebody, you don't even bother to fight with them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Close to two decades after the show wrapped, the two aren't on the same set every day, but they've continued to be close.
