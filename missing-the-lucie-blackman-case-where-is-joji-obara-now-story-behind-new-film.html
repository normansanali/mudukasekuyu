It was here where she'd meet Joji Obara, a regular client at the high-end club. The pair decided to meet up outside the club but Lucie was then never seen again.</p><p id=e5miNjV_SEd data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>5 must-watch shows to check out on Netflix in August 2023</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e3NAENgew1C data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Deepest Breath: What happened to divers Alessia Zecchini and Stephen Keenan?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ab1307082a27-sophie-blackman-lucies-sister.jpg><p id=eTLABOyd7Ce data-wc=29>Lucie's roommate and friend she had moved to Japan with, Louise Phillips, had been told she had joined a cult, but an investigation into something more sinister then commenced.</p><p id=eMPKqx5qpl9 data-wc=63>Lucie's father, Tim, outlines in the documentary how he received a phone call a couple of days after his daughter had disappeared. At first, however, he was certain that the matter would be resolved. "I said, 'Well how do you know she is missing?'," before he added: <strong>"I immediately thought there must be some rational explanation why she has not got in touch."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4a113a37431e-tim-blackman-netflix-doc.jpg><p id=ecdBra2v1yW data-wc=49>But Lucie did not get in touch and, for the next seven months, an international investigation took place to find out what happened to the 21-year-old. Authorities and government officials in the UK, including then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Japanese counterpart, made it their priority to find Lucie.</p><p id=eFXaniHKjLz data-wc=36>Joji Obara, who was a Japanese-Korean businessman, was made the main suspect in Lucie's disappearance after he admitted to meeting with her on the night of their date, however, he denied involvement in her going missing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3ad5ee7f2518-missing-lucie-blackman-case.jpg><p id=e1olarfPNxu data-wc=29>It wasn't until the following year that the harrowing truth came to light. On February 9, 2001, <strong>authorities found Lucie's dismembered body close to where Obara's home was located.</strong></p><p id=eJr9-V_vZr1 data-wc=43>Two months later, police arrested Obara and he was charged with the abduction, rape, and disposal of Lucie's body. He was also charged with similar crimes to nine other women including the death of an Australian woman, Carita Ridgeway, between 1992 and 2000.</p><h2>Where is Joji Obara now?</h2><p id=eGnjpwQ6diX data-wc=56>The trial of Joji Obara went on for five years and in April 2007, he was found guilty and given a life sentence for the rape charges relating to the other victims. However, much to the horror of the Blackman family, the court found him not guilty of the charges against him in relation to Lucie.</p><p id=e4hJ-_pr4zy data-wc=50>However, this decision was appealed and in 2008, the family received a small amount of justice when he was found guilty of the abduction, dismemberment, and disposal of Lucie's body, according to the Independent. But the courts ruled that there was not enough forensic evidence to determine the murder charge.</p><p id=ewtqXQsDv3u data-wc=15>Obara continues to serve his life sentence in a prison in Japan to this day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e7fa96a36fcb-joji-obara.jpg><h2>What has the response been to Missing: The Lucie Blackman Case?</h2><p id=ehVjG0l2BXW8 data-wc=50>The documentary has received praise for how sensitively Netflix handled the case. Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, one viewer shared their admiration for the family and friends of Lucie, as well as the detectives who worked on the case, for sharing the harrowing story behind her tragic death.</p><p id=ecfwmGYTWeCa data-wc=40>They wrote: <strong>"Just watched this and I have such admiration for Lucie's dad Tim and how strong he was and the Japanese detectives who are so respectful of Lucie's memory year after year.&nbsp;</strong>Tastefully done and definitely worth a watch."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/abad4718e4a1-family-of-missing-lucie-blackman.jpg><p id=eeqegvSHWeO4 data-wc=32>Another shared on social media: "Found this [film] really interesting.
