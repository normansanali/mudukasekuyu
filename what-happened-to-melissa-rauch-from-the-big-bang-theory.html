Most of these have included <a href=#>some remarkable achievements</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Mayim Bialik and Kaley Cuoco</a> both have their own shows today, namely Call Me Kat and The Flight Attendant respectively. The latter also recently starred in a sci-fi rom com titled Meet Cute, although the film has <a href=#>not been very well received by critics and viewers</a>.</p><p>Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki and Kunal Nayyar have all gone on to take on significant roles since Big Bang. These have been quite divergent trajectories for a group of stars who <a href=#>became very close in real life</a> during their time working together.</p><p>Perhaps the best illustration of this friendship was when the main cast members all took a pay cut in order to boost Bialik’s salary – as well as that of Melissa Rauch – who they felt were <a href=#>being originally underpaid</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'The Big Bang Theory' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bialik and Rauch would go on to become part of the main cast themselves. With the former now starring in and producing her own sitcom, what has Rauch been up to?</p><h2 id=melissa-rauch-is-married-to-screenwriter-winston-beigel>Melissa Rauch Is Married To Screenwriter Winston Beigel</h2><p>As well as her very successful career, Melissa Rauch appears to enjoy a pretty stable family life. The actress is currently <a href=#>married to screenwriter Winston Beigel</a>, who even took on her surname after they walked down the aisle.</p><p>The pair met at Marymount Manhattan College, and started dating soon after. Their connection was not just romantic, as they also started collaborating on a number of projects. As well as her gifts in front of the camera, Rauch is also a talented writer, and Beigel quickly became her partner in the craft.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among other productions that the pair wrote together was the 2005 stage play, The Miss Education of Jenna Bush. They also created the story and penned the script for the movie The Bronze in 2015, a sports comedy-drama in which Rauch also starred. The film was produced by the Duplass brothers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>16 Pics Of Melissa Rauch That Change The Way We See The Big Bang Theory Star</a></span></p><p>Rauch and Beigel officially got married in 2007. Their daughter Sadie was born in December 2017, and they also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed a son named Brooks</a> in May 2020.</p><h2 id=melissa-rauch-tried-her-hand-in-movies-after-the-big-bang-theory>Melissa Rauch Tried Her Hand In Movies After The Big Bang Theory</h2><p>The final episode of The Big Bang Theory was broadcast on May 16, 2019. Later that year, Melissa Rauch featured in two films. First, she played a character called Bethany in the romantic comedy Ode to Joy, also starring Martin Freeman and Deadpool star Morena Baccarin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That particular movie was released in theaters across the United States in August. The following month, Rauch appeared as Melanie Martin in The Laundromat, a biographical comedy-drama by Steven Soderbergh on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>.</p><p>This was not the first time that the actress was wading into big screen territory, however. Among others, she had previously starred in movies like I Love You, Man, Flock of Dudes and Ice Age: Collision Course (voice role).</p><p>In 2017, Rauch also voiced the famous <a href=#><strong>DC</strong></a> character Harley Quinn / Dr. Harleen Quinzel in the animated superhero film Batman and Harley Quinn by Bruce Timm. The movie was given a direct-to-video release.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Big Bang Theory: 15 Times Melissa Rauch's Bernadette Was The Hottest</a></span></p><p>After her time on Big Bang, Rauch also featured in another animated direct-to-video film, titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cats & Dogs: Paws 3 Unite!</a> in 2020. She played Gwen the Cat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-else-has-melissa-rauch-done-since-the-big-bang-theory>What Else Has Melissa Rauch Done Since The Big Bang Theory?</h2><p>While she has proven her worth on the big screen, it is on television that Melissa Rauch has continued to thrive professionally. In fact, her very first post-Big Bang gig was yet another voice role: Betty Spaghetty in an episode of Robot Chicken which was dubbed Molly Lucero in: Your Friend's Boob.</p><p>While the 42-year-old has had multiple other TV roles in the years since, none of those have been a live action one. That is set to finally come in early 2023, when she takes on the leading character in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Court, a reboot of the similarly-titled sitcom</a> of the 1980s on NBC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Rauch is currently playing a recurring role in Disney’s Firebuds. She voices a therapist called Beth, who is also the mother of main character Bo Bayani (Declan Whaley). Last year, she also appeared as herself in 10 episodes of Jeopardy!.</p><p>Before that, she portrayed the infamous French queen Marie Antoinette in an episode of Steven Spielberg’s Animaniacs on Hulu. The episode was titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">France France Revolution</a> and aired in November 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brnEpaCsq5Fiv6LBwqFkn6qfonq1tMRmmaKfXZeur7OMrZ%2Bep6KufA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-melissa-rauch-from-the-big-bang-theory.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Melissa%20Rauch%20From%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-melissa-rauch-from-the-big-bang-theory.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-melissa-rauch-from-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Melissa%20Rauch%20From%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-melissa-rauch-from-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Melissa%20Rauch%20From%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-melissa-rauch-from-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Melissa%20Rauch%20From%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-melissa-rauch-from-the-big-bang-theory.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Melissa%20Rauch%20From%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-do-the-property-brothers-live.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Do the Property Brothers Live?
