Note: Line twists are bad for anglers because twists can weaken the line and they also can cause the line to get itself into knots when casting (ex: those pesky wind knots). <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on saltstrong.com</a><h2>Do swivels scare away fish?</h2>They allow you to try a variety of lures quickly and also minimize line twists. On the other hand, they are one more thing that can fail, and their bulkiness can potentially scare fish or kill your lure's action. Read on to see why I'd suggest having some in your tackle box, but probably not tied on every rod. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on iterminalpro.com</a><h2>Should you use a swivel with a spinner?</h2>Many spinner fishermen prefer fishing with a snap swivel. The only advantage to this is it allows them to change lures quickly. We do not recommend attaching a spinner directly to a swivel. Most fishermen use a swivel that is way too big and this can interfere with the action of the lure. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on mepps.com</a><h2>Is it OK to use a swivel with lures?</h2>Anything added to the front of the lure like a swivel will lead to less strikes in clean water. You can get away with swivels and snap swivels when the water is murky or if you are fishing in low light scenarios but most of the time it will lead to fewer hook ups. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on fishyourassoff.com</a><h2>Should you use snap swivels with fishing lures?

When the fish is reeled up to the surface, the gasses expand and can cause the eyes to become bulged, cloudy or crystallized and the stomach to protrude out of the mouth.

In shallow cover—wood, stumps, clumps of grass—I like to use a spinner bait with a red or pink head, and a crank bait with red hooks. The red makes the fish think the bait's injured, and they'll bite at it. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on discoverboating.com</a><h2>Do you use a swivel when jigging?</h2>Wondering if I should use a swivel for these types of spoons or if that means I am jigging too much??
