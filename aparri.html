Therefore, he is single but is so occupied having a blast on Animal Jam and keeping his YouTube channel updated that he doesn’t seem interested in dating anyone currently.</p><p>Furthermore, his fans send him mails and gifts through his PO Box and he is grateful for the love his supporters’ shower on him. On the other hand, he is also disliked by other jammers who try to bring him down but he doesn’t let their petty remarks affect him.</p><h2><span id=Body_measurements>Body measurements</span></h2><p>Aparri has not revealed his exact <strong>height</strong> but he weighs around 65 Kgs.
