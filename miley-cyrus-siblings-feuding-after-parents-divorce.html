Although she's often accused of gaining fame because of her famous last name and industry connections, few deny that she is a talented and gifted performer.</p><p>Miley Cyrus' transition from a child star to an adult has, the singer has admitted, been difficult as her image has drastically changed throughout her career. So, too, has her personal life as the singer was once famously married to Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, which resulted in one of Hollywood's messiest break-ups.

Before age 11, she had already had a cameo in her dad's TV series Doc and had acted in a major motion picture titled Big Fish, which Tim Burton directed.</p><p>In her memoir Miles to Go, Cyrus frequently recounted how a group of mean girls in school would bully her daily. One instance struck Cyrus the hardest:</p><p>"They started cussing me and telling me to get up. I sat there, frozen. I didn't know what to do. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I wasn't chicken. What could they do to me? People surrounded me. I stood up, still a foot shorter than they were, and said, 'What's your problem? What did I ever do to you?" Cyrus added that her classmates answered: "Your dad's a one-hit wonder.

We will always be family and look forward to a continued and loving shared experience as friends and parents.

Billy Ray Cyrus also had a son, Christopher Cody, with his girlfriend before marrying Miley Cyrus' mother. Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus also have three kids: Miley, Braison, and Noah.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Miley-Cyrus-siblings.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Noah Cyrus, Miley Cyrus' younger sister and a successful singer in her own right, once spoke about the difficulties of growing up in a famous family: "...being born in the family I was in, everyone gave me such a hard time for having a hard time being Miley's little sister. But you know, I always felt like I was that person that no one gave a [expletive] about due to what people said to me online. It was absolutely unbearable. And that's why I write, 'My sister's like sunshine, bringing good light wherever she'll go/and I was born to rain clouds, blessed in her shadows.' Because, that's what everybody always says to me, that no matter what, I was going to be in that shadow."</p><p>By all accounts, the Cyrus family experienced their share of family drama over the years, but none more so than when Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus split up for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A divide between the siblings occurred when their parents began dating other people.
