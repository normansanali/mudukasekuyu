Also, what is her overall net worth?</p><p>Keep reading for some surprising information about the "Vision of Love" songstress.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much does Mariah make every Christmas?</h2><p>People started to wonder just how much money Mariah made every year after the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> claimed in 2015 that since 1994, Mariah's instant-classic song made her £376,000 annually (at current rates, that's over $400,000!). However, fans were skeptical of whether that figure was accurate.</p><p>A 2014 article in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> claimed that "over the course of 19 years — from 1994 to 2013 — the song made [Mariah] a total of $50 million in royalties. When we calculate that out on an annual basis, it's $3.8 million per year."</p><p>It's possible those figures, while unspecified, were global, and definitely out-measured the Daily Mail's figures.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>As it turns out, per a 2017 report in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Economist</a>, "All I Want for Christmas Is You" in the U.S. alone provided Mariah with $60 million between 1994 and 2016, meaning it nets her an average of approximately $2.6 million per year.</p><p>That's not even counting the U.K. royalties, the streaming plays, and more. In 2020, Mariah went the extra mile by also airing a Christmas special on Apple TV Plus known as <a href=#>Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas Special</a>. The exact monetary figure that special netted her was never disclosed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Mariah Carey's net worth?</h2><p>For however impressive Mariah's income is around Christmastime alone, the amount that she has brought in throughout her career as a whole is staggering. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Mariah is worth around $320 million, an impressive sum that is attributed to not only her music but her work as an entrepreneur and an actress as well.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Mariah Carey</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer and songwriter</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $320 million</p><p>Mariah Carey is a singer, songwriter and actress who has sold over 220 million records worldwide. She is best known for her songs "Hero," "All I Want For Christmas Is You," and "One Sweet Day." Mariah has won five Grammy awards over the course of her career, and she was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2022.</p><p><strong>Birthdate</strong>: March 27, 1969</p><p><strong>Birthplace</strong>: Huntington, NY</p><p><strong>Marriage</strong>: Previously married to Tommy Mottola (1993-1998) and Nick Cannon (2008-2016)</p><p><strong>Children</strong>: 2</p><p>To put it simply, Mariah is one of the most successful female music acts in history. She has sold more than 200 million albums, has more <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No.1 songs</a> in her discography than any other female writer-producer on the U.S. music charts, and has been the recipient of a slew of some of the industry's biggest awards.</p><p>Some of the endeavors Mariah has undertaken outside of music include creating a line of footwear, handbags, jewelry, and fragrances, as well as authoring the book, The Meaning of Mariah Carey. Much like her music, Mariah's book was a resounding success, becoming a number-one New York Times bestseller and being lauded by both fans and critics alike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFllKSytHnMmqmimZhisKK%2BxLJkppmbmnqmwsSrsGabmKe2tMDMmqo%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-does-mariah-carey-make-every-christmas.html&text=The%20Amount%20of%20Money%20That%20Mariah%20Carey%20Makes%20Every%20Holiday%20Season%20Will%20Surprise%20You&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-does-mariah-carey-make-every-christmas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-does-mariah-carey-make-every-christmas.html&title=The%20Amount%20of%20Money%20That%20Mariah%20Carey%20Makes%20Every%20Holiday%20Season%20Will%20Surprise%20You" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-does-mariah-carey-make-every-christmas.html&title=The%20Amount%20of%20Money%20That%20Mariah%20Carey%20Makes%20Every%20Holiday%20Season%20Will%20Surprise%20You" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-does-mariah-carey-make-every-christmas.html&title=The%20Amount%20of%20Money%20That%20Mariah%20Carey%20Makes%20Every%20Holiday%20Season%20Will%20Surprise%20You" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-does-mariah-carey-make-every-christmas.html&description=The%20Amount%20of%20Money%20That%20Mariah%20Carey%20Makes%20Every%20Holiday%20Season%20Will%20Surprise%20You" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./when-and-where-does-demon-slayer-take-place.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When and where does Demon Slayer take place?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./talking-to-ike-barinholtz-about-the-mindy-project-madtv-and-his-game-of-thrones-audition-tape-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Talking to Ike Barinholtz About The Mindy Project, MADtv, and His Game of Thrones ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
