Difficult family dynamics, isolation, or reminders of where we fall short of societal expectations can drive us to the edge. Perhaps that is why some crimes seem to strike right at holiday peak. Whatever the reason, it’s clear the holidays are not a happy time for everyone. So here are 12 notorious true crime holiday cases that will have you feeling like someone left you a lump of coal in your stocking.</p><h2 id=h-laci-peterson data-injectable=false>Laci Peterson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/scott-peterson.png><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Laci Peterson was America’s missing daughter when she disappeared on Christmas Eve 2003. However, she wasn’t just someone’s daughter, she was about to become someone’s mother. Laci was eight months pregnant with her first child, Connor, with her husband Scott Peterson.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>However, baby Connor would never get a chance at life, as his and his mother’s bodies were found a few months later. Even more unbelievable than their deaths, was the person responsible for them, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Peterson</a>. Peterson was convicted in 2004 and while justice was served, for many in the Modesto, California community, Christmas Eve is still a bittersweet time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Carnation Christmas Murders</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/carnation.jpg><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Carnation, Washington was normally a quiet, sleepy Seattle suburb, but on Christmas Eve 2007 gunshots rang out through the town.

According to the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Seattle Times</a>, Anderson claimed she was “tired of everyone stepping on her,” and angry with her brother for reportedly not paying back a large sum of money he borrowed.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>Anderson was convicted of six counts of aggravated first-degree murder, and was sentenced to six life sentences.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sodder Children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sodder-children.jpg><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>On Christmas Eve in 1945 in the small town of Fayetteville, West Virginia, a horrible house fire ripped through the Sodder family home. The home was inhabited by George and Jennie Sodder, and nine of their children. Four of the children found their way to safety, but the other five were assumed to be lost in the fire. …Or were they?</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>The great mystery around the Sodder family continued when no remains were found in the ashes. Other details also proved suspicious, and Mr. Sodder began to believe his missing children might still be alive. Sightings of the children have popped up over the years, as have a variety of conspiracy theories. It remains one of the most mysterious unsolved true crimes to this day.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dayton Ohio Murders</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/dayton-daily.jpg><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Christmas of 1992 in Dayton, Ohio will live on in infamy for years to come.

Standing at the door was a man dressed as Santa Claus, and he had a gun.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>The man was Bruce Jeffery Pardo, and he was the ex-husband of Sylvia Ortega, the daughter of the owners of the home. Angered by his recent divorce, Pardo opened fire on the entire family, killing eight and injuring others, including Leticia Ortega’s 8-year-old daughter. It was a tragedy that rocked the community for decades to come.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>JonBenét Ramsey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cnn.jpg><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>JonBenét Ramsey was a six-year-old Colorado beauty queen who was well-known in the pageant world.

They seemed every bit the average farming family, but on Christmas 1929 that all changed. Pictured, the family huddles together for a final family portrait the day before Christmas. By the following day, every member of the Lawson family except for one, would be dead at Mr. Lawson’s hands.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>On Christmas Day, Mr. Lawson took a 12 gauge shotgun, shot and killed his wife and 6 children, and then turned the gun on himself.

His crimes began on December 18th, when he killed his wife, adult son, and young grandaughter. When his other children arrived home, he also murdered them. On December 26th, unsuspecting holiday guests of the Simmons family arrived at the home, and Simmons killed seven more friends and family members upon their arrival.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>In town, he went on a shooting spree at the mini mart where he had worked, and several other locations.

Brandon stabbed his mother and beat her with a baseball bat, claiming voices in his head told him to.

DNA was able to determine the woman was Jocelyn Meyer Sommers, 69. Although finally identified, many questions around her death still remain unanswered. Her family was unable to provide clarity on why she had ended her life, why she had chosen the cemetery, or how the Christmas tree had gotten there.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Atkins Murders</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/arkansas.jpg><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>On Christmas Day in 2020, police received a phone call saying there were five people dead inside a home in Atkins, Arkansas.

To this day, exactly what happened in that small home on Christmas Day, or why, remains a chilling mystery.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>The holidays are assumed to be a time of peace and joy, and it’s easy to forget that crime doesn’t take a day off even when the rest of the world does.
