I have creative control of doing whatever I want to do.”</p><p>She loves&nbsp;connecting with fans&nbsp;whether through chatting or photos and videos, but lately has received an influx of one specific inquiry.</p><p>“It’s funny to me because I get a lot of requests for my feet, and it cracks me up,” she said. “People want to see feet.”</p><p>Fans have flocked to the subscription-based site to get a chance to interact with their favorite celebrity, which also includes&nbsp;Donna D’Errico, Denise Richards, and her daughter, Sami Sheen.</p><p>Electra cannot quite put her finger on the foot fetish phenomenon, but she will happily oblige with a photo or two showing off her pedicure.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Actress Carmen Electra joined OnlyFans one year ago and has indulged in a career resurgence. <span class=credit>E!

I’ll just grab my phone,” Electra said, relaying how easy it is for her to share on the site.</p><p>“That’s what I like. I use my phone. I don’t think anyone wants to see that super professional photos.&nbsp;They want to see you.”</p><p>She added, “So I’ll just do a video of my feet and think of something … try to come up with different ideas of how you can show your feet, or ask them, ‘How would you like to see my feet?'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram">The 51-year-old revealed that one of her most requested photos from her millions of fans from Onlyfans are feet pictures.&nbsp;</figure><p>Having complete creative control over her image and content is a dream come true for Electra.</p><p>“If there’s a photo I don’t want them to use, I won’t send it. I get to oversee everything,” she said. “After, you know, over 150 covers of Playboy, I figured, why not? I love it. I love being my own boss.”</p><p>She previously told Fox News Digital, “It’s intense and very empowering. It’s so self-empowering. And creatively, I’ve always had so many fun and creative ideas, and there have been times when I’ve been able to follow through with those with different projects I’m working on.”</p><p>The former MTV star recently brought the heat to summer when she reconnected with&nbsp;Jenny McCarthy&nbsp;to <a href=#>model for Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS swimwear collection</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Electra pictured for Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS swimwear collection. <span class=credit>Skims</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The former MTV star recently reconnected with Jenny McCarthy to model for Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS swimwear collection. <span class=credit>Skims</span></figure><p>Seeing the “Singled Out” hosts back in action together made fans even hungrier for a reboot of another <a href=#>one of their favorite ’90s show, “Baywatch.”</a></p><p>While speculation has been in the air for years about a possible reboot, Electra is not so sure if that is happening.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s been mentioned to me and I always say, of course, because it would be so much fun to come back,” she said. “I mean, just going back and doing the reunion in Hawaii was so much fun.”</p><p>Electra starred as lifeguard Lani McKenzie on the hit show which ran from 1989-2000.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Electra was pictured on the set of “Baywatch” in 1998 where she played the character Lelani McKenzie. <span class=credit>Everett Collection</span></figure><p>“We went through a lot in LA,” she said of the cast and crew, which included&nbsp;David Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, David Charvet, and D’Errico, to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>“Much respect to the entire cast that worked for many, many years on that show, because it’s wild.”</p><p>“You would get sucked under in a wave and, you know, we had to dive off this boat, and we’re running on the sand and our feet would be hot,” she said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The actress was a host for the MTV show “Singled Out,” which ran from 1995-1998. <span class=credit>FilmMagic, Inc</span></figure><p>“It’s a lot. It doesn’t seem like it is, but when you get down, and really do it and want it to look very authentic … it was a crazy time.”</p><p>Electra’s wild times began early in her career, though.</p><p>She grew up in Cincinnati and trained professionally as a dancer with hopes of touring as a “backup dancer for&nbsp;Janet Jackson.”</p><p>She was recording demos with Capitol Records <a href=#>when she caught the eye of Prince, who was putting together an all-girl group.</a></p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Electra said she loves connecting with fans whether through chatting or photos and videos. <span class=credit>Getty Images for iHeartRadio</span></figure><p>“He wanted to sign me and literally got me out of my deal at Capitol, and I was off and running, just like, ‘Wow, this is crazy. This is my life right now,’” she said.</p><p>“It was almost hard to believe. I just remember showing up and there was a purple limo that picked me up at the airport. I got in the limo and his brother Duane was driving, and Duane was just security.”</p><p>Electra recalled, “I guess Prince said, ‘Take her shopping. Get her some clothes.’ It was about creating our music and what I was going to do with it.”</p><p>She was inspired by his passion for every aspect of creating a performance.</p><p>“It was really such a creative avenue and just a way for me to get over my fears, to become fearless,” she said. “It was a blast.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmamlfmK6zucSnZJ6klZjBs62Mq5yvnZGhwG7AzqlkqKacrrOiutJmqZ6ppZrAtXnWoqOdZZ%2BXwKa%2F0qKmp2WWp7yuecWoo6Wnp5q%2FtHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcarmen-electra-reveals-top-onlyfans-request-wild-obsession-from-followers.html&text=Carmen%20Electra%20reveals%20top%20OnlyFans%20request%2c%20%27wild%20obsession%27%20from%20followers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcarmen-electra-reveals-top-onlyfans-request-wild-obsession-from-followers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcarmen-electra-reveals-top-onlyfans-request-wild-obsession-from-followers.html&title=Carmen%20Electra%20reveals%20top%20OnlyFans%20request%2c%20%27wild%20obsession%27%20from%20followers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcarmen-electra-reveals-top-onlyfans-request-wild-obsession-from-followers.html&title=Carmen%20Electra%20reveals%20top%20OnlyFans%20request%2c%20%27wild%20obsession%27%20from%20followers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcarmen-electra-reveals-top-onlyfans-request-wild-obsession-from-followers.html&title=Carmen%20Electra%20reveals%20top%20OnlyFans%20request%2c%20%27wild%20obsession%27%20from%20followers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcarmen-electra-reveals-top-onlyfans-request-wild-obsession-from-followers.html&description=Carmen%20Electra%20reveals%20top%20OnlyFans%20request%2c%20%27wild%20obsession%27%20from%20followers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christopher-cross-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christopher Cross Net Worth  How Much is Cross Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./black-tap-milkshakes-copycat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Black Tap Milkshakes Copycat  Modern Honey">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
