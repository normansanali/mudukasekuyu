In case you missed it, he is also a fan-favorite. And fans have not only been curious about him, but they have also wanted to know about his parents Marty and Tracy Glaze. So, the writing below is just about them.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Love Is Blind Who Are Marshall Glaze’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Marshall Glaze’s parents are seemingly lovely, supportive folks. At the same time, they seem very much fond of Marshall, and he of them. Let us get to know each one of them, together and individually in the rest of the writing.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Marty Glaze, Marshall Glaze’s Father</strong></h3><p>Marshall Glaze’s father, Marty Glaze is the son of the late Hilah Theresa (Brown) Glaze and Jack of Baltimore, Maryland. The now-deceased couple had the privilege of renewing their wedding vows on their 50th wedding anniversary in August 2001, just two weeks before Jack was called home to heaven. Hilah followed him later in August 2010.</p><p>Marty also grew up alongside his siblings Jackie, Renee, Mark, and Lisa.</p><p>Marty’s mom, who had a tremendous love for family, instilled that value in her kids as well. And together, she and her husband also made sure that their children know the value of a good education. As a result, all of them including Marty successfully earned college degrees.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Marty Glaze Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Marty Glaze was born around the last week of February. What day and what year exactly was not known though.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Marty Glaze Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Since 2003 and as of March of 2023, Marty Glaze has been working as the President of Commercial Construction&nbsp;in Hanover, Maryland.</p><p>On his LinkedIn, Marty also gushed about having over 30 years of experience in the construction industry and having worked for some of the largest firms in Maryland. All these times, he said, his mission has been to create the best and finest general contracting company that can compete at the highest levels.</p><p>He acquires a B.S. in Civil Engineering from Union College. He went there for the program from 1982 – 1986.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Is Marty Glaze On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes. Marty Glaze could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@mdglaze</a> with 144 posts and 308 followers as of 2 April 2023.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Tracey Glaze, Marshall Glaze’s Mother</strong></h3><p>Marshall Glaze’s mother Tracey Glaze is one of nine children born of the late Nelson Mc Millan, Sr., and the late Ollie Mae McMillan. The fourth one of them, her sister the late Eunice Marie Hunter of Glen Rogers, West Virginia passed away on 31 March 2020.</p><p>The remaining siblings of Tracey are her three brothers, Matt McMillan (married to Gwen), Ray McMillan, and Lorenzo McMillan (married to Alice), and two sisters, Lillie Hatcher, and Penny McMillan. Their oldest brother, Nelson Mc Millan, Jr., and sister Margo McMillan are no more.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Tracey Glaze Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Tracey Glaze was born in March 1964. So, she turned 59 years old in 2023.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Tracey Glaze Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Professionally, Tracey Glaze is a registered nurse working in Baltimore City County, Maryland. On her LinkedIn, she talked about her 20+ years of experience as a registered nurse with an extensive background in multiple acute care settings.</p><p>Since March 2016 and as of now, she has been working as a travel registered nurse around Boca Raton, Florida. Currently, she seemed to be working as a float nurse at Northwest Hospital in Baltimore. She has also&nbsp;for 8 different hospitals in the Maryland and Virginia areas.</p><p>She acquires a bachelor’s degree in Registered Nursing from the University of Maryland Baltimore.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Is Tracey Glaze On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Tracey Glaze does not seem to have any social media accounts, including an Instagram one, as of April 2023.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>Where Do Marshall Glaze Parents Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Both Marshall Glaze’s parents seemed to be residing in Baltimore City County, Maryland.</p><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>How Many Kids Do Marshall Glaze Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Marshall is not the only child of his parents. There are two more and they are his sister Morgan Glaze and brother Marcus Glaze.</p><p>Marcus studied at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. Also, at this point, he mentioned being single and a Baltimore, Maryland dweller. Morgan on the other hand studied at Johns Hopkins University. She, like both her brothers, was born and brought up in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>Speaking of their age: Marcus turned 29 in April 2023, Marshall turned 27 on 21 September 2022, and Morgan it seems is of age in between the two of them.</p><p>About these siblings, we also learned that Morgan is also a mother of Zoë Chanel. Also, Marshall is&nbsp;in a relationship with his fiancé and fellow Love Is Blind contestant Jackelina Bonds.</p><p>So, you know, Marshall and his siblings are also related to Justin Glaze from Season 17 of The Bachelorette. They are first cousins.</p><ul><li><h4 style=text-align:left><strong>Are Marshall Glaze Parents Still Together?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Marshall Glaze’s parents are no more together. And Marty even has moved on with another partner. The latter two’s pictures on Marty’s social media go back as far as 2016. With pride, Marty refers to her as the love of his life. And this very person’s IG <a href=#>@kiaboose</a> for some reason was unavailable as of April 2023.</p><p>As for Marshall’s mom, she chose not to tell the world even if she decided to see anyone again. Or maybe she was not there just yet.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmppmiqLWiuMtmnqWZqpp6sa3RnqWtq12irrPA2GaYp5xdqb%2Bir8SyZKCkka%2Bybq3GnmSjp5Jk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarshall-glaze-parents-marty-and-tracey-glaze-age-job.html&text=Who%20Are%20Marshall%20Glaze%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Marty%20And%20Tracey%20Glaze%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarshall-glaze-parents-marty-and-tracey-glaze-age-job.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarshall-glaze-parents-marty-and-tracey-glaze-age-job.html&title=Who%20Are%20Marshall%20Glaze%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Marty%20And%20Tracey%20Glaze%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarshall-glaze-parents-marty-and-tracey-glaze-age-job.html&title=Who%20Are%20Marshall%20Glaze%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Marty%20And%20Tracey%20Glaze%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarshall-glaze-parents-marty-and-tracey-glaze-age-job.html&title=Who%20Are%20Marshall%20Glaze%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Marty%20And%20Tracey%20Glaze%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarshall-glaze-parents-marty-and-tracey-glaze-age-job.html&description=Who%20Are%20Marshall%20Glaze%20Parents%3f%20Meet%20Marty%20And%20Tracey%20Glaze%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./real-frankenstein-experiments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="7 Real Frankenstein Experiments Carried Out By Mad Scientists">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wish-napoleon-hunger-games-box-office-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which Movie Is the Most Thankful at the Box Office?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
